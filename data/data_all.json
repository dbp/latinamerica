Its Classic manifestation occurred\nbetween ad 300 and 900 in the Peten jungle of northern Guatemala, though\nit is believed that Maya culture may have originated in around 1000 bc on\nthe coast of the Gulf of Mexico in the area near Veracruz, which also saw\nthe rise of Olmec culture. If so, Maya culture would have been remotely\ncognate with the Aztec.\n<br>\nClassic Maya society fell victim to the mysterious decline that first afflicted\nTeotihuacan. By the middle of the eighth century the Classic sites in the\nPeten had been abandoned. In about ad 900 a Post-Classic Maya culture\nemerged at the northern tip of the Yucatan peninsula; this was the result of\na fusion with elements of central Mexican culture brought to the Yucatan\nby Toltec invaders, who conquered Yucatan and made their capital at\nChichen Itza, introducing new styles of architecture and art. The power of\nChichen Itza had declined by the thirteenth century and it was succeeded by\na new empire, whose centre was at Mayapan, but this too had disintegrated\ninto smaller states by the time the Spaniards arrived.\n<br>\n\nThe economy of the Mayas was based on maize, which was cultivated by\nslash-and-burn methods that exhausted the soil within a short period. A\nconsequence of this form of agriculture was a tendency for peasants to live\nin makeshift settlements of pole and thatch rather than in villages. Maya\ncities were therefore less concentrated than those in central Mexico, and were\nprimarily religious and administrative centres, where the priesthood and the\nnobility lived, though it appears that there was more residential settlement\nby the common people than was previously thought, especially in the main\ncities of northern Yucatan like Chichen Itza and Mayapan.\n<br>\nMaya kingdoms were ruled by a leader with religious as well as political\nauthority; society was divided into a class of commoners on the one hand\nand an upper class of priests, warriors and administrators on the other.\n'Empires' were created when a kingdom was able to exact tribute and labour\nfrom other smaller states. Like the Aztecs, the Mayas believed that a succession\nof worlds had been created and destroyed, and that the present era would\nalso have an apocalyptic ending. To put off this calamity they sacrificed\nhuman beings and practiced various forms of expiation. Their concern with\nthe fate of the cosmos produced a complex calendrical system and a well-\ndeveloped mathematics, which discovered the concept of zero several centuries before any other people in history.

Their myths relate how\ntheir first ruler, Manco Capac, brought the tribe to that valley either from\nthe shores of Lake Titicaca or, in another version, from the 'windows' or\ncaves at Paccari-Tambo, a place some eighteen miles south-east of Cuzco.\nLike Quetzalcoatl for the Toltecs and Aztecs, the mythical figure of Manco\nCapac was revered as the bringer of civilization to the world; he was also\nworshipped for being a direct descendant of the Sun God. a family connection\nwhich gave Inca rulers a quasi-divine status.\n<br>\nIn the late fourteenth century the Incas subjugated the other tribes in\nthe Cuzco valley, and their imperial career began in earnest in 1438, when the\ngreat conqueror. Yupanqui Inca Pachacuti. 'the Transformer', ascended the\nthrone Between 1438 and 1463 he extended Inca rule to the region of Lake\nTiticaca, and thence north-west. Other conquests by both Pachacuti and his\nson Topa Inca brought northern territories as far as Quito under Inca control.\nPachacuti it was who laid the foundations of the well-organized Inca state\ncentred upon Cuzco, a holy city which possessed the imposing Temple of\nthe Sun representing the very source of Inca power. In 1471 Pachacuti was\nsucceeded by Topa Inca, who, having already subdued the great Chimu\nkingdom in the north, ventured south into present-day Chile, establishing\nthe limit of Inca power at the River Maule in the territory of the Araucanian\nIndians. From 1493 the next supreme Inca. Huayna Capac, became involved\nin an extended campaign against rebellious ethnic kingdoms on the northern\nfrontier zones, especially around Quito. Upon Huayna Capac's death some\ntime between 1525 and 1528, his natural son Atahuallpa seized these frontier\nterritories with the help of several important generals and launched a coup\nd'etat against the legitimate successor, his half-brother Huascar. It was during\nthe ensuing civil war that Francisco Pizarro happened to arrive in the\nkingdoms of the Sun.\n<br>\nIn less than a hundred years the Incas had built the most formidable empire\nin the Western Hemisphere. Like that of the Aztecs, their dominion was\ncharacterized essentially by the levying of tribute from scores of subject\nkingdoms and tribes. But the Incas went much further than the Aztecs in\ndeveloping a centralized bureaucratic state at the service of a supreme ruling\nclass. In this the physical peculiarities of the Andean region were directly\ninfluential.\n<br>\n</p><p class=\"entry columns\">\nThe geography of the area covered by the Inca empire is marked by great\ncontrasts of climate and terrain. Ascending from the rainless deserts of the\ncoast to the snow-capped peaks of the Andes, one passes through sharply\nvarying ecological environments. On the coast, agrinculture is possible only\nin the vicinity of rivers or on land under irrigation; fishing has therefore\nalways been important. In the highlands, altitude determines the kind of\ncrops that can be produced; for instance, maize will grow well up to 11,000\nfeet while at higher levels tubers and grams can be cultivated. In the cold,\nwindswept puna - steppe-like grasslands just below the snow-line - no\nagriculture is possible, though pasture is available for the llamas, vicunas and\nother ruminants that provide meat and wool. Each level forms an 'ecological\ntier' yielding a particular range of produce, and yet there is not enough fertile\nland on any one tier to sustain a large population.\n<br>\nOver the centuries Andean societies developed a way of overcoming this\nproblem by sending out settlers to cultivate crops at different altitudes in\norder to complement the produce of their native territories. Andean societies\nwere not therefore territorially integrated units, but took rather the form of\n'vertical archipelagos* comprising the ancestral homeland - which provided\nthe core of tribal identity - and outlying agrarian settlements on a number\nof ecological tiers specializing in various types of produce for distribution\nand exchange among the dispersed branches of the tribe. Geography thus\nproduced a unique economic structure, which, in turn, determined social\nvalues and practices. Where fertile land, being scarce, needed to be so carefully\nhusbanded, it is little wonder that its distribution had to be closely regulated\nby the community and that a spirit of co-operation should be so highly\nprized among members of the tribe. As a result, the two ruling principles of\nAndean tribal society were redistribution and reciprocity.\n<br>\n</p><p class=\"entry columns\">The basic social unit was the ayllu, an extended kinship group or clan\nsimilar to the calpulli in Middle America. Each ayllu possessed land which it\nallocated to heads of families, who could cultivate it for themselves but were\nnot allowed to sell it to others. It was common practice within the ayllu for\nan individual member to work a neighbour's fields in return for similar\nassistance; he would also render tribute by taking turn to labour for a time\nin the fields of the ayllu headman and the tribal chieftains. Given the intrinsic\ndifficulties of the terrain, the ayllus had to join together to perform certain\ncollective tasks, such as the building of terraces to enlarge the area of\ncultivation and the construction of systems of irrigation. Because of the threat\nof crop failure in such a fickle climate, a number of public warehouses were\nused to store grain and other crops for distribution in case of famine. The\nproduce from the different ecological tiers had to be distributed to all the\nayllus in the tribe. Thus the geography of the Andes dictated a high degree\nof collective action and central regulation within the tribal communities.\n<br>\nThe Incas elaborated upon these traditional practices of communal regulation and reciprocal services in order to build an imperial state. Inca imperialism did not eliminate local identities; rather, it added a higher stratum of\nauthority to the pre-existing tribal hierarchies. Traditional ethnic chieftains,\nunder the supervision of Inca governors and Inca garrisons, were responsible\nfor the collection of tribute from their people for the Inca aristocracy. Tribute\nwas received from subject peoples largely in the form of labour. The local\ntraditions of collective work were taken over by the imperial state and\ntransformed into the mita, a system of forced labour by which the colonized\nSupreme Being, Viracocha, creator of the universe, from\nwere ultimately derived. The doctrine of Viracocha's pre-eminence,\nhowever, did not displace the cult of the Sun God. Inca cosmogony, like \nthat of the Aztecs and the Mayas, divided the history of the universe into\n'suns', each age having been brought to an end by a cataclysm. The Fifth\nSun had been inaugurated by the Inca Manco Capac, and it was his descendants who were charged with ensuring the continuing survival of\nthe world through sacrifice and expiation. Although not as prodigal of human life as\nthe Aztecs, the Incas sacrificed youths, girls and children - all of whom had\nto be physically perfect - on occasions when the usual sacrifice of llamas was\ndeemed insufficient to save the world from calamity.\n<br>\n</p><p class=\"entry columns\">\nThe religious establishment was large and influential. A hierarchy of\npriests, headed by immediate relatives of the Inca himself, served the many\ntemples and huacas found throughout the empire: at the Temple of the Sun\nin Cuzco some 4,000 people were engaged in the ministry of the state\nreligion. Religious communities of 'chosen women', who were recruited as\nyoung girls from all parts of the empire, performed a variety of duties: some\nmight be selected for sacrifice to the gods, others as concubines for the Inca\nand his favorites; the rest would be employed in weaving precious vicuna\nwool into garments for the royal family, or in preparing food and libations\nfor the frequent ceremonies that were held by priests and nobles.\nThis very close identification of religion with government afforded enormous power to the Inca state. In the remains of great buildings in Cuzco, in the massive fortress of Sacsahuaman or in the ruined city of Macchu Picchu,\nall constructed with huge boulders cut to shape and fitted exactly into place,\nthere survive impressive monuments to its extraordinary capacity to mobilize\nhuman labour. Perhaps extreme regimentation by the state was necessary to\ncompensate for technical deficiencies in an otherwise sophisticate civilization: without beasts of burden or knowledge of the wheel, the Incas depended crucially on manpower. But their true success lay in the skill with which they built up a polity that transcended by far the limits of the tribe.\nThe business of government was turned into a dynastic monopoly based on privileged knowledge, not just as regards the arcana of religion but also at a\nmore mundane level: the absence of a system of writing restricted important information to a closed oligarchy, who had access to records kept on knotted cords known as quipus. Such privileged knowledge increased the possibilities\nof political control over the passive multitude of commoners whose cultures remained entirely oral. So long as belief in the divine origin of the Inca dynasty and in its right to extensive privileges could be upheld, the edifice\nof state would remain in place. In 1531, however, Francisco Pizarro\nand his company of infidels found their way into the Inca empire, Tahuantin-suyu,\ncausing that great pyramid of state to collapse when they violated the sacred\npinnacle of its authority.\n<br>\nIn the Lima museum, there are hundreds of skulls which have undergone trepanning and the insertion of gold and silver plates by Inca surgeons. </p>","source":"\nThe Penguin History of Latin America, Edwin Williamson"},{"id":"poweur1494","title":"","type":"power","loc":"eur1","start":1494,"end":1494,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, allowed Portugal to occupy Latin America territories below a dividing line traced by the Pope</p>","source":"Open Veins of Latin America"},{"id":"powhai1495","title":"","type":"power","loc":"hai1","start":1495,"end":1495,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">A handful of cavalry, 200 foot soldiers, and a few specially trained dogs decimated the Indians.

He was reported to have much gold; so Espinosa by sea, and Pizarro by land started out after the mountain chieftain. Urracá sent his women, children, and infirm to a place of safety and fiercely attacked the Spaniards with his fighting men. The licentiate was getting the worst of it, when Hernando de Soto came up with thirty of Pizarro's men and saved the Spaniards.

The Carib were found throughout the islands, but specifically populated the Lesser Antilles, while the\nArawak chiefly inhabited the Greater Antilles. When these indigenous peoples\nwere first encountered, the Spanish simply called them indios or identified them according to the name of their respective chiefs, villages, or island location. The name Taino, which came into common use only in the\nearly decades of the twentieth century and by which these tribal groups are generally known today was assigned to them by historians and anthropologists to refer to the entire indigenous population of the western Caribbean region.\nIn 1498, in an attempt to placate discontented colonists on the island of\nHispaniola, Christopher Columbus distributed to each them a parcel of land\nand the preexisting Indian communities on each. Spanish colonists could\nthen force the Indians on their land to work without the compensation of\nwages in a state of serfdom or slavery, known in Spanish as encomienda or\nrepartimiento. Juan Ponce de Leon, appointed by Governor Nicholas de\nOrvando, arrived at Puerto Rico and began to colonize the island in 1508.\nWith a portion of Ihe Spanish fleet and the authorization of the Crown, he\nbegan to exploit the island in the search for gold and captured native Taino\nto work as slaves on Hispaniola.\nThree years later, the Taino of Puerto Rico revolted against the rule of\nthe Spanish with little success. Ponce de leon ordered that six thousand be\nshot, but many fled the island. The following year, forty slaves owned by\nDiego Colon, the son of Christopher Columbus, resisted for several months\nbefore finally being caught and executed. The Dominican friars on Hispanola,\ndisheartened by the slow extermination of the Arawak, suggested that slaves,\nboth white and black , should be imported to the islands. In 1512, in order to\ndiscourage Portuguese slave smuggling and in response to the writings of the\nDominican friars, the Spanish government began to grant licenses to bring\nslaves directly from Africa to the Americas.\nIn 1527, the first major slave rebellion occurred in Puerto Rico as dozens\nof slaves, likely of both African and indigenous origin, fought against the\nSpanish colonists in a brief and ultimately ill-fated revolt. The few slaves\nwho escaped during this uprising relreated into the mountains where they\nresided as maroons wilh surviving Taino. Similar uprisings continued until the nineteenth century when slavery was finally abolished on Puerto Rico.

In the independence period the area, now a part of Bolivia, still had a larger population than what is now Argentina. A century and a half later Bolivia's population is almost six times smaller than Argentina's.\n<br>\nPotosian society, sick with ostentation and extravagance, left Bolivia with only a vague memory of its splendors, of the ruins of its churches and palaces, and of 8 million Indian corpses. Any one of the diamonds encrusted in a rich caballero's shield was worth more than what an Indian could earn in his whole life under the mitayo, (A mitayo is an Indian who pays a mita. or tribute, usually in the form of forced labor in public works, especially the mines) but the caballero took off with the diamonds. If it were not a futile exercise, Bolivia—now one of the world's most poverty-stricken countries—could boast of having nourished the wealth of the wealthiest. In our time Potosi is a poor city in a poor Bolivia: &quot;The city which has given most to the world and has the least,&quot; as an old Potosian lady, enveloped in a mile of alpaca shawl, told me when we talked on the Andalusian patio of her two-century-old house. Condemned to nostalgia, tortured by poverty and cold, Potosi remains an open wound of the colonial system in America: a still audible &quot;J'accuse.&quot; \n<br>\nIn three centuries Potosi's Cerro Rico consumed 8 million lives. The Indians, including women and children, were torn from their agricultural communities and driven to the Cerro. Of every ten who went up into the freezing wilderness, seven never returned. Luis Capoche, an owner of mines and mills, wrote that &quot;the roads were so covered with people that the whole kingdom seemed on the move.&quot; In their communities the Indians saw &quot;many afflicted women returning without husbands and with many orphaned children&quot; and they knew that &quot;a thousand deaths and disasters&quot; awaited them in the mines. The Spaniards scoured the countryside for hundreds of miles for labor. Many died on the way, before reaching Potosi, but it was the terrible work conditions in the mine that killed the most people. Soon after the mine began operating, in 1550, the Dominican monk Domingo de Santo Tomas told the Council of the Indies that Potosi was a &quot;mouth of hell&quot; which swallowed Indians by the thousands every year, and that rapacious mine owners treated them &quot;like stray animals.&quot; Later Fray Rodrigo de Loaysa said: &quot;These poor Indians are like sardines in the sea. Just as other fish pursue the sardines to seize and devour them, so everyone in these lands pursues the wretched Indians.&quot; Chiefs of Indian communities had to replace the constantly dying mitayos with new men between eighteen and fifty years old. The huge stone-walled corral where Indians were assigned to mine and mill owners is now used by workers as a football ground. The mitayos' jail—a shapeless mass of ruins—can still be seen at the entrance to Potosi.</p>","source":"Open Veins of Latin America"},{"id":"redstarpan15521557","title":"BAYANO!","type":"redstar","loc":"pan1","start":1552,"end":1557,"entry":"<p class=\"entry shen\">King Bayano, a Mandinko and alleged Muslim who was captured by slavers in West Africa, leads escaped slaves in the largest sixteenth-century revolt against Spanish colonial rule in Panama.</p>","source":""},{"id":"culteur1557","title":"Avoidance and Damnation","type":"culture","loc":"eur1","start":1557,"end":1557,"entry":"<p class=\"entry columns\">Ideological justifications were never in short supply.

The Indians were used as beasts of burden because they could carry a greater weight than the delicate llama, and this proved that they were in fact beasts of burden. The viceroy of Mexico felt that there was no better remedy for their &quot;natural wickedness&quot; than work in the mines. Juan Gines de Sepulveda, a renowned Spanish theologian, argued that they deserved the treatment they got because their sins and idolatries were an offense to God. The Count de Buffon, a French naturalist, noted that Indians were cold and weak creatures in whom &quot;no activity of the soul&quot; could be observed. The Abbe De Paw invented a Latin America where degenerate Indians lived side by side with dogs that couldn't bark, cows that couldn't be eaten, and impotent camels. Voltaire's Latin America was inhabited by Indians who were lazy and stupid, pigs with navels on their backs, and bald and cowardly lions. Bacon, De Maistre, Montesquieu, Hume, and Bodin declined to recognize the &quot;degraded men&quot; of the New World as fellow humans. Hegel spoke of Latin America's physical and spiritual impotence and said the Indians died when Europe merely breathed on them.\n<br>\nIn the seventeenth century Father Gregorio Garcia detected Semitic blood in the Indians because, like the Jews, &quot;they are lazy, they do not believe in the miracles of Jesus Christ, and they are ungrateful to the Spaniards for all the good they have done them.&quot; At least this holy man did not deny that the Indians were descended from Adam and Eve: many theologians and thinkers had never been convinced by Pope Paul III's bull of 1537 declaring the Indians to be &quot;true men.&quot; When Bartolomé de las Casas upset the Spanish Court with his heated denunciations of the conquistadors' cruelty in 1557, a member of the Royal Council replied that Indians were too low in the human scale to be capable of receiving the faith.

In Mexico, it was the supreme court of administration and judgment.) of Guadalajara that a third of Latin America's Indians had already been wiped out, and that those who survived were compelled to pay the tributes for the dead. The monarch added that Indians were bought and sold; that they slept in the open air; and that mothers killed their children to save them from the torture of the mines. Yet the Crown's hypocrisy had smaller limits than the empire: it received a fifth of the value of the metals extracted by its subjects in all of the Spanish New World, as well as other taxes, and the Portuguese Crown was to have the same arrangement in eighteenth- century Brazil. Latin American silver and gold—as Engels put it—penetrated like a corrosive acid through all the pores of Europe's moribund feudal society, and, for the benefit of nascent mercantilist capitalism, the mining entrepreneurs turned Indians and black slaves into a teeming &quot;external proletariat&quot; of the European economy. Greco-Roman slavery was revived in a different world; to the plight of the Indians of the exterminated Latin American civilizations was added the ghastly fate of the blacks seized from African villages to toil in Brazil and the Antilles. The colonial Latin American economy enjoyed the most highly concentrated labor fore known until that time, making possible the greatest concentration of wealth ever enjoyed by any civilization in world history.<br>\n  \nThe price of the tide of avarice, terror, and ferocity bearing down on these regions was Indian genocide: the best recent investigations credit pre- Columbian Mexico with a population between 30 and 37.5 million, and the Andean region is estimated to have possessed a similar number; Central America had between 10 and 13 million. The Indians of the Americas totaled no less than 70 million when the foreign conquerors appeared on the horizon; a century and a half later they had been reduced to 3.5 million. In 1685 only 4,000 Indian families remained of the more than 2 million that had once lived between Lima and Paita, according to the Marquis of Barinas.

Over a quarter of the population perished as a result of endemic warfare, famine and disease, including the last major outbreak of plague in the country. The architect of the English reconquest of the island, Oliver Cromwell, described Ireland as ‘a clean paper’, which, following the victory of the New Model Army, could be remodelled in the interests of the Westminster parliament. The Act of Settlement, passed in August 1652, outlined in detail the fate of the country and its inhabitants. The preamble reassured the general populace that the parliamentary regime did not intend ‘to extirpate the whole nation’, offering instead to extend mercy to ‘the inferior sort’, as long as they lived peacefully under the colonial government. The act contained a number of clauses, specifically excluding certain groups and named individuals from the general pardon. \n<br>\nPredictably, the first clause condemned those accused of killing Protestant settlers at the outbreak of the rebellion in 1641. The parliamentarians defined ‘involve-ment’ in the broadest possible sense to include not only those actively ‘bearing arms’ but also any person who assisted the rebels in any way. Technically, at least, this covered the vast bulk of the Catholic population. The second clause excluded all Catholic clergy from pardon, and hundreds were subsequently killed or banished overseas. The next clause listed over 100 named individuals, mostly prominent Catholic political and military leaders, some of whom had already departed for the Continent. All of them forfeited their extensive estates, and the colonial authorities in Dublin reserved the right to move any individual to another part of the country if deemed necessary for reasons of ‘public safety’. \n<br>\nDespite the potentially all-encompassing nature of the exclusion clauses, the Act of Settlement was primarily concerned with dispossessing Catholic landowners, thus enabling the parliamentary regime to repay its supporters, both soldiers and financiers, with confiscated land. During the remainder of the 1650s, the government transplanted over 40,000 people across the River Shannon into Connacht, where they could be effectively corralled and controlled. The common soldiers and ‘inferior sort’ provided a lucrative source of revenue for merchants with shipping at their disposal. As the war drew to a close, the parliamentarians, anxious to rid the country of hostile soldiers, licensed military entrepreneurs to transport large numbers into Spanish service. From 1652, articles of surrender invariably contained specific terms enabling Catholic commanders to depart for the Continent with their men. Between 1651 and 1654, as many as 40,000 Irishmen sailed for the Continent, often on English merchant ships. Many of these exiles dreamed of returning home, but few ever did. \n<br>\nWhile the government encouraged enemy soldiers to leave the country, a different fate awaited those civilians unsuitable for military service. In the early decades of the seventeenth century, England acquired a number of islands in the Caribbean, such as Barbados and Montserrat, and began to develop lucrative tobacco and sugar plantations. African slaves provided most of the field labour, but a demand also existed for indentured servants of European stock, who worked for a fixed period of time, ‘under a yoke harsher than that of the Turks’, before eventually obtaining their freedom. From the 1630s, official accounts record the arrival of the Irish in the Caribbean, many of them kidnapped by press-gangs operating in the vicinity of the principal ports in Munster. The journey across the Atlantic took almost three months, and those who survived the crossing found living and working conditions on the plantations extremely harsh. After seven years of service, a handful did acquire small landholdings, but none that we know of ever returned to Ireland. \n<br>\nThe outbreak of the rebellion in 1641 temporarily disrupted the Atlantic trade, but transportations resumed after Cromwell’s invasion in August 1649. The first shipment occurred towards the end of that year, when, after the storming of Drogheda, Oliver Cromwell ordered the few surviving members of the garrison to be sent to Barbados. Over the coming years, thousands of military prisoners were sold in perpetuity to plantation-owners to work in the fields, effectively as slaves. Despite the departure of so many soldiers to the Continent at the end of the war, small Tory bands continued to pose a serious, if localised, military threat throughout the 1650s. Local parliamentary commanders usually executed captured Tories, or else arranged for them to be shipped to the Caribbean, along with those civilians accused of assisting them.\n<br>\nThe war had also created a large number of widows and orphans, many of them destitute and homeless. Over the next ten years, unscrupulous merchants shipped thousands of these Catholic women and children across the Atlantic. The authorities in Dublin, concerned by the ‘great multitudes of poor swarming in all parts of this nation’, welcomed this trade as a means of clearing the country of vagrants. They also periodically emptied the jails by sending shiploads of convicts to the colonies, a practice that continued until the late nineteenth century, with Australia replacing the West Indies as the principal destination. In 1655, as part of the war against Spain, an English fleet captured Jamaica. Shortly afterwards, the government in Ireland arranged for over 2,000 Catholic boys and girls to be transported there in an attempt to repopulate the island. \n<br>\nThe Irish did not always meekly accept their fate. In 1655, runaway Irish and African slaves in Barbados began attacking local militia forces, killing plantation-owners and destroying crops. It took the authorities the best part of two years to suppress the disorder. The island continued to be plagued by vagrant Irish, encouraging slaves to rebel against their masters. Some of the more adventurous managed to escape from English-controlled territory to the French colonies, such as the Leeward or Windward Islands, while others joined the numerous pirate fleets that roamed freely throughout the Caribbean for much of the seventeenth century. The collapse of the Cromwellian regime and the restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 brought an end to large-scale transportations. Most of the Irish indentured servants had been freed by 1680, although shipments of convicted Tories continued throughout the reign of Charles II. Their descendants continue to reside in the Caribbean, particularly on the island of Montserrat, where Irish surnames such as O’Connor, Fitzgerald and O’Carroll are still to be found today.  \n<br>\n<i>Micheál Ó Siochrú’s God’s executioner: Oliver Cromwell and the conquest of Ireland will be published shortly by Faber.</i>\n</p>","source":""},{"id":"powbra1654","title":"Expulsion of Holland from Brazil","type":"power","loc":"bra7","start":1654,"end":1654,"entry":"<p class=\"entry shen\">Portuguese expel the dutch from Brazil</p>","source":""},{"id":"warhai1655","title":"","type":"","loc":"hai1","start":1655,"end":1655,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">French capture the island of Haiti from Spain</p>","source":""},{"id":"warjam1656","title":"","type":"","loc":"jam1","start":1656,"end":1656,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">English ships capture Jamaica from Spain, provoking a war.</p>","source":""},{"id":"powsur1667","title":"","type":"power","loc":"sur1","start":1667,"end":1667,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">Under the treaty of Breda, English Occupation of New Netherland is exchanged for the Dutch occupation of Surinam</p>","source":""},{"id":"powbra1680","title":"Sacramento","type":"power","loc":"bra8","start":1680,"end":1680,"entry":"<p class=\"entry shen\">Portuguese establish the colony of sacramento in West Brazil.</p>","source":""},{"id":"indmex16801692","title":"A Successful Revolt","type":"ind","loc":"mex1","start":1680,"end":1692,"entry":"<p class=\"entry columns3\">\n\n\n<div style=\"float:right; margin:0px 10px;width:200px\">\n<img src=\"../mapimages/mexicopopay.jpg\">\n<p class=\"caption\">\nA statue of Popay in the US Capitol Building, unveiled in 2005, celebrates the history of the rebellion against the Spanish.</p>","source":""},{"id":"powarg1683","title":"","type":"power","loc":"arg1","start":1683,"end":1683,"entry":"<p class=\"entry shen\">Portuguese establish the colony of Colonia on the River Plate in Argentina</p>","source":""},{"id":"econafr1711","title":"The African Slaves","type":"economy","loc":"afr1","start":1700,"end":1711,"entry":"<p class=\"entry columns\" style=\"column-fill:balance\">The slaves spent their strength and their days in the gold-washing installations. &quot;There they work,&quot; wrote Luis Gomes Ferreira, a doctor who lived in Minas Gerais during the first half of the eighteenth century, &quot;there they eat, and often there they have to sleep; and since when they work they are bathed in sweat, with their feet always in the cold earth, on stones, or in water, when they rest or eat their pores close and they become so chilled that they are susceptible to many dangerous illnesses, such as very severe pleurisies, apoplectic and paralytic fits, convulsions, pneumonia, and many other diseases.&quot; The <i>capitaes do mato</i> of Minas Gerais collected rewards in gold for the severed heads of slaves who tried to escape. Disease was a blessing from heaven because it meant the approach of death.<br>\nThe slaves were called the &quot;coins of the Indies&quot; when they were measured, weighed and embarked in Luanda in the Portuguese colony of Angola; in Brazil those surviving the ocean voyage became &quot;the hands and feet&quot; of the white master. Angola exported Bantu slaves and elephant tusks in exchange for clothing, liquor, and firearms, but Ouro Preto miners preferred blacks shipped from the little beach of Ouidah on the Gulf of Guinea because they were more vigorous, lasted somewhat longer, and had the magic power to find gold. Every miner also needed a black mistress from Ouidah to bring him luck on his expeditions. (In Cuba, medicinal powers were attributed to female slaves. According to onetime slave Esteban Montejo, &quot;There was one type of sickness the whites picked up, a sickness of the veins and male organs. It could only be got rid of with black women; if the man who had it slept with a Negress he was cured immediately.&quot;) Ouro Preto's appetite for slaves became insatiable; they expired in short order, only in rare cases enduring the seven years of continuous labor. Yet the Portuguese were meticulous in baptizing them all before they crossed the Atlantic, and once in Brazil they were obliged to attend mass, although they were not allowed to sit in the pews or to enter the chanel.\n<br>\nThe gold explosion not only increased the importation of slaves, but absorbed a good part of the black labor from the sugar and tobacco plantations elsewhere in Brazil, leaving them without hands. The miners were contemptuous of farming, and in 1700 and 1713, in the full flush of prosperity, hunger stalked the region: millionaires had to eat cats, rats, ants, and birds of prey. A royal decree in 1711 banned the sale of slaves occupied in agriculture, with the exception of those who showed &quot;perversity of character.&quot;\n<br>\n<img src=\"../mapgimages/middlepassageslavery.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;break-after: always\">\n\n</p>","source":"Open Veins of Latin America, Galeano"},{"id":"econbra17011799","title":"Brazilian mining and emigration boom","type":"economy","loc":"bra9","start":1701,"end":1799,"entry":"<p class=\"entry columns\">In the eighteenth century Brazilian production of the coveted metal exceeded the total volume of gold that Spain had taken from its colonies in two previous centuries. Adventurers and fortune hunters poured in. Brazil had 300,000 inhabitants in 1700; a century later, at the end of the gold years, the population had multiplied eleven times. No less than 300,000 Portuguese emigrated to Brazil in the eighteenth century, a larger contingent than Spain contributed to all its Latin American colonies. From the conquest of Brazil until abolition, it is estimated that some 10 million blacks were brought from Africa; there are no precise figures for the eighteenth century, but the gold cycle absorbed slave labor in prodigious quantities.\n<br>\nSalvador de Bahia was the Brazilian capital of the prosperous Northeastern sugar cycle, but the &quot;golden age&quot; in Minas Gerais moved the country's economic and political capital southward and Rio de Janeiro, the region's port, became the new capital in 1763. In the dynamic heart of the new mining economy, camps bloomed abruptly into cities, described by a contemporary colonial authority as &quot;sanctuaries for criminals, vagabonds, and malefactors,&quot; in a vertigo of easy riches. The &quot;Vila Rica de Ouro Preto&quot; (The &quot;Rich Town of Black Gold,&quot; so called because the mined gold turned black on exposure to the humid air, due to the presence of silver. -Trans.) had grown to city size by 1711; born of the miners' avalanche, it was the quintessence of the gold civilization.

But Brazilian gold was channeled to London by licit as well as illicit methods. The gold boom, which brought a host of Portuguese to Minas Gerais, sharply stimulated colonial demand for industrial products and at the same time provided the means to pay for them. Just as Potosi silver rebounded off Spanish soil, Minas Gerais gold only reached Portugal in transit. The metropolis became an intermediary. In 1755 the Marquis de Pombal, Portugal's prime minister, tried to revive a protectionist policy, but it was too late. He declared that the English had conquered Portugal without the trouble of a conquest, that they were supplying two-thirds of its needs, and that British agents controlled the whole of Portuguese trade. Portugal was producing almost nothing, and the wealth brought by gold was so illusory that even the black slaves who mined it were clothed by the British.<br>\nCelso Furtado has noted that Britain, following a farsighted policy with respect to industrial development, used Brazilian gold to pay for essential imports from other countries and could thus concentrate on investments in the manufacturing sector. Thanks to this historical graciousness on the part of the Portuguese, Britain could apply rapid and efficient technical innovations. Europe's financial center moved from Amsterdam to London.

The rebels then marched from plantation to plantation, and at each, unhappy slaves joined the cause. During the rebellion, many whites were killed, and many plantations and fields were burned.The uprising was led by a slave named Cuffy, a cooper(barrel maker) in the colony.

It was in New York, in 1784, that Francisco de Miranda conceived\rthe idea of 'the liberty and independence of the whole Spanish American\rcontinent'. The model of revolution offered by France had less appeal. As\rMiranda observed in 1799, &quot;We have before our eyes two great examples,\rthe American and the French Revolutions.

God forbid that the other countries suffer the same fate\ras Saint-Domingue, scene of carnage and crimes, committed on the\rpretext of establishing liberty; better that they should remain another\rcentury under the barbarous and senseless oppression of Spain.&quot;\n<br>\nMiranda argued that it was vital for him to reach Venezuela first, before\rthe Haitians did, and in 1806 he led a tiny expedition to his homeland.\rUnfortunately for his reputation he stopped to re-group in Haiti, where\rhe was advised not to be content with exhorting the Creoles to rise but &quot;to\rcut off heads and burn property&quot;, and where a rumour started that he\rplanned to use black Haitians.34 In fact, Miranda was as socially conservative\ras other Creoles and he had no intention of inciting a race war.

Shortly before Brazil's political independence in 1822, the Belem\relite began a heady orgy of political temper tantrums, pitting Portuguese\ragainst Creole in petty politicking that eventually broke into the open\rwarfare known as the Cabanagem revolt. The political rhetoric and vitriol\rdid not reflect fundamental social or economic differences between\rthe participants but simply questions of political method and the spoils of\roffice. However, by engaging numbers of the semifree peasants and\rdetribalized Indians of the region (known as caboclos), workers, and marginal\rsmall farmers to do the physical fighting, the elite foretold their own\rdestruction. In 1835, when the lower class eventually rose in rebellion\ragainst the men they perceived as authority figures, a good many individuals\rof the ruling class died violent deaths.\n<br>\rMost of the fighting and destruction during the Cabanagem took place\rin and around Selem, but outbreaks of violence occurred all over the basin.\rIt was a localized rebellion over local issues, with limited ideological\rscope that spread over an immense territory. It was not a revolt with a\rclear agenda or purpose, but the violence was often a matter of personal\rgrudges and vendettas. The caboclos struck out against those individuals\rwhom they saw as having wealth and power over them, most often being\rthose of European ancestry. Although not clearly defined enough to be\rcalled race and class warfare, the Cabanagem was definitely a war between\rthe haves and have-nots. The elite class suffered serious losses, as many died during the shelling of Belem or disappeared after fleeing the\rcity.\n<br>\rWhen most of the fighting had ended by 1836, the survivors from the\relite class slowly reestablished their economic control of the basin. In\rtime, they would again guide the reins of economic growth, but they remained\rextremely cautious about their relationship with the caboclos. As\rthe issue of colonization and settlement of new areas became a major topic\rof debate, the residual fear of the violent potential of the caboclos may\rwell have been one reason for the decision to bring foreign immigrants\rrather than resettle and subsidize the native paraenses. The elites had no\rintention of allowing the caboclos any opportunity for advancement.\n</p>","source":"Colonization As Exploitation in the Amazon Rain Forest, 1758-1911\n By Robin Leslie Anderson"},{"id":"warbra18351845","title":"The War of Tatters","type":"","loc":"bra4","start":1835,"end":1845,"entry":"<p class=\"entry columns\">\nThe second rebellion, chronologically, was quite different in nature. It became known as the Farroupilha, a name used to characterize the radicals after the abdication of Pedro I, and took place in the southern province of Rio Grande do Sul. The province had over 100,000 inhabitants, and the capital, Porto Alegre, had, in 1830, a population of between 12,000 and 15,000. As in Para, slaves composed more or less 30 per cent of the total population. But Rio Grande do Sul had a very different social structure from the rest of Brazil. The historical circumstances of the formation of the province had led to a fusion of military status and landownership, and the militarized dominant class exercised almost total control over the subordinate groups in society. Moreover, the province had gone through an important economic transformation in the second decade of the century, moving from agriculture to livestock production. A charque industry also developed along the coast. The occupation of the Banda Oriental in 1817 had given a tremendous boost to the estancieiros. They not only bought land in what became the Cisplatine Province but also transferred vast numbers of cattle to Brazil. The loss of the Banda Oriental in 1828 had been a severe blow, although it did not stop the regular smuggling of cattle across the frontier. In fact, economic and political relations among the estancieiros of Rio Grande do Sul, Uruguay and the Argentine provinces of Entre Rios and Corrientes were an important factor in the rebellion of 1835. They formed a powerful group of caudillos in search of a political organization that could best suit their interests.\r<br>\rThe beginning of the revolt was not very different from that of the Cabanagem, in the sense that it turned around the reaction of local liberals against the formation of the caramuru Sociedade Militar in 1833 and against a president appointed by the regency. The president, who suspected secessionist plans among the local leaders, was overthrown in September 1835. Under the next president, himself a rich estancieiro, factions coalesced and in February 1836 open war broke out. In September 1836 the farroupilhas proclaimed the independence of the province under a republican government, although they were not able to keep control of the capital.In 1839, with the help  of a small naval task force organized by the Italian revolutionary, Giuseppe Garibaldi, they invaded the neighbouring province of Santa Catarina, where a shortlived republic was also proclaimed. The fight dragged on for ten years until an armistice was agreed in March 1845.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>","source":"THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF LATIN AMERICA"},{"id":"powbol18361839","title":"Peru and Bolivia form a confederation.","type":"power","loc":"bol1","start":1836,"end":1839,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">The Peru–Bolivian Confederation (or Confederacy) was a short-lived confederate state that existed in South America between 1836 and 1839, a loose union between the states of Peru and Bolivia.

The local hacendados were successfully growing henequen—sisal, a fibre-producing agave—for export and had few ties with central Mexico. Quite naturally, Yucatan embraced federalism and in 1839 rebelled against Mexico with the help of Mayan soldiers, becoming for all practical purposes an independent state. In 1840, the American traveller, John L. Stephens, found the Indian peons submissive and humble. Two years later, after his second visit, he warned:\n<i><font style=\"color:#cc0000;\">\rWhat the consequences may be of finding themselves, after ages of servitude, once more in the possession of arms and in increasing knowledge of their physical strength is a question of momentous import to the people of that country, the solution of which no man can foretell.</font>\n<br>\n</i>\rStephen's forebodings were borne out five years later. In return for the service of Indian peasants as soldiers, the whites had promised to abolish or at least reduce parochial fees, to abolish the capitation tax payable by all Indian adults, and to give them free use of public and communal lands. None of these promises were fulfilled and the Mayas rebelled in the summer of 1847 with the aim of exterminating or at least expelling the white population. The revolt soon developed into full-scale war, known ever since as the War of the Castes. Mexico had just been defeated by the United States and, even had it wished to do so, was unable to send an army to Yucatan to suppress the revolt. In the cruel war which followed, the Indians almost succeeded in driving their enemies into the sea. In their despair, the whites went as far as to offer Yucatan to Great Britain, the United States, or, indeed, any country willing to protect them.\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"../mapimages/castewaryucatan.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;column-span: all;COLSPAN=2;\">\n\n<br>  \rWhile Yucatan was in the throes of this race war, Indian tribes, forced southward by the expansion of the United States, invaded the sparsely populated regions of northern Mexico, burning haciendas, villages and mining settlements, and indiscriminately killing their inhabitants. Again, the Mexican government was too weak to prevent these incursions.\n<br>  \nSocial and ethnic revolt took a different form in central Mexico. Here the Indians did not form a compact, linguistic group and nor were they in a clear majority, as were the Mayas in Yucatan. However, deserters from the army, fugitives from justice, vagrants and similar elements, taking advantage of Mexico's military defeat and the chaos which followed, formed armed bands which began to terrorize the countryside. In at least one district, in the mountains of the states of Guanajuato, Queretaro and San Luis Potosi, a revolutionary agrarian movement developed. This so- called Sierra Gorda rebellion sought to give free land to hacienda tenants and peons, but the rebels were not strong enough to attack cities, and they had to be satisfied with the burning of haciendas. The Mexican ruling class, demoralized, embittered and divided, watched helplessly as the remnants of their once great country were beginning to fall apart.\n<br>  \nFollowing the caste wars of 1847—55 they managed to set up an independent state in southern Yucatan and until 1901 resisted numerous attempts by federal troops to re-establish Mexican sovereignty. Moreover, armed with weapons they purchased in neighbouring British Honduras, they frequently ventured out to raid adjacent Mexican territories with relative impunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>","source":"THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF LATIN AMERICA Vols. 4 and 5"},{"id":"powmex1847","title":"","type":"power","loc":"mex1","start":1847,"end":1847,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">US forces make an amphibious landing and capture Vera Cruz in Mexico</p>","source":""},{"id":"redstar18481849","title":"","type":"redstar","loc":"bra6","start":1848,"end":1849,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">Praieira revolt</p>","source":""},{"id":"powmex1848","title":"","type":"power","loc":"mex1","start":1848,"end":1848,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">US troops enter Mexico City, by the peace of Guadaloupe-Hidalgo, Mexico cedes all territory north of the Rio Grande to the USA.</p>","source":""},{"id":"powusa1848","title":"Buying Cuba","type":"power","loc":"usa1","start":1848,"end":1848,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">In May, Democrats in the United States nominate for\npresident Senator Lewis Cass, who has publicly advocated the\npurchase of Cuba.

A band of about 300 adventurers, mainly negroes from Jamaica, had occupied the port of San Juan del Norte, and began to commit depredations upon an adjacent settlement of Americans known as Punta Arenas. Finally they organised a strong force to demolish tho little colony at Punta Arenas, but their design was defeated by the interposition of an American warship which happened to be in the harbor. \n<img src=\"../mapimages/nicaragua1854.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%\">In May of 1854 matters were further complicated by the attempt of a body of men from Greytown to arrest in Punta Arenas the captain of one of the boats of the Accessory Transit Company of Nicaragua on a charge of murder. Solon Borland, the American minister to powers, Central Ammica, happened to be present on this occasion, and, believing that the captain of the steamboat was innocent and that the intruding party had no jurisdiction, interposed effectually to prevent violence and bloodshed. Borland afterward visited Grey town and, while there, was subjected to insult by a mob. On receiving offical accounts of these occurences, the sloop of war <i>Cyane</i> was sent to enforce the demands of the American government—that the people of Greytown make reparation for injuries to our citizens and due-apology for their insult to Borland. But the Greytown people evinced no disposition to comply, so on July 9, 1854, after 24 hours' notice had been given, the <i>Cyane</i> opened fire on the town.

Mexico's liberal president, Ignacio Comonfort (1812-63), was forced into\nexile by conservative general Félix Zuloaga (1814-76), who took control of the capital,\nMexico City, and assumed presidential powers in early 1858, until he was replaced by Miguel\nMirarnon (1832-67), a conservative. A rump congress met in Querétaro and proclaimed\nBenito Juarez (1806-72), a liberal, president in 1858. \n<br>\nIn Mexico City, the conservatives controlled the regular army and were supported by the church and the wealthy. The government of\nthe liberals, who had a poorly equipped militia, was forced to flee from Querétaro to Guadalajara, from there to the Pacific coast and then to Panama. Finally, it made its capital the Mexican port of Veracruz on May 4, 1858. The United States recognized the Mexican government there in\n1859 and gave arms to the liberals. The liberal army under Santos Degollado (d. 1861) fought in the west but lost every major battle, includ-\ning notable defeats at Tacubaya (April 11, 1859) and Celaya (November 1859). Miramon and his forces attempted to drive Juarez out of Veracruz\nin early 1859, but many of his men sickened and died in the lowland. \n<br>\nDegollado marched on Mexico City but suffered defeat at Chapultepec in April 1859. Desperately needing money, Juérez's government confiscated church property and thus was able to better arm and equip its armies. Jesus Gonzalez Ortega (1824-81) led liberal troops to victory near Guadalajara and afterward at Calderon (1860). 0rtega's decisive defeat of Miramon's forces at the Battle of Calpulalpam on December 20, 1860, opened the way\nto Mexico City, which Juarez entered on January 1, 1861; he then assumed full control of the country and put into effect the reforms in the constitution.\n</p><p class=\"entry columns3\" style=\"font-size:70%;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;\">\n\n<strong style=\"color:#cc0000\"> Abraham and Benito</strong><br>\nA Juarez-led liberal coalition triumphed over conservatives attempting to defend the privileges of the Church. The latter were particularly enraged by the Ley Juarez (the Juarez Law), legislation that restructured the judicial system to limit the authority of military and ecclesiastical courts, and by the liberal constitution of 1857.\n<br>\nThough Abrahama Lincoln and Juarez never met personally, they formed a lifetime, long-distance mutual admiration society. Lincoln's attitude toward Juarez was no doubt shaped by the friendly feeling he perennially entertained toward Mexico. Lincoln strongly opposed the U.S.-Mexican War of 1846-1848, characterizing it as &quot;a war of conquest brought into existence to catch votes,&quot; and adding that, &quot;Mexico was in no way molesting or menacing the U.S.&quot;\n<br>\nWhile it is not known exactly when Juarez came to Lincoln's attention, we do know that Lincoln was a strong Juarez supporter by 1857, eve of the Reform War. When Juarez was temporarily driven out of Mexico City by the conservatives, Lincoln sent him a message expressing hope &quot;for the liberty of . . . your government and its people.&quot;\n<br>\nThe bond between the two leaders was greatly strengthened during the American Civil War. In 1861, the year the Civil War began, Juarez was elected president of Mexico. The Reform War had bankrupted Mexico's treasury and Juarez suspended debt payments to Mexico's chief European creditors, France, Britain and Spain. The European powers organized a punitive expedition, seizing Veracruz. But Britain and Spain pulled out when they learned of Napoleon III's desire to install a puppet government in Mexico City. The French, defeated at Puebla in 1862, poured in reinforcements and captured Mexico City in 1863. Fleeing the capital, Ju&amp;aacut;erez organized resistance in the north.\n<br>\nThough Lincoln obviously had his hands full during the Civil War, he still did what he could to help Juarez. Union General Phil Sheridan wrote in his journal that, &quot;we continued covertly supplying arms and munitions to the liberals, sending as many as 30,000 muskets from the Baton Rouge alone.&quot; To Sheridan came this order from General Grant, which of course originated from Lincoln: &quot;Concentrate at all available points in the States an army strong enough to move against the invaders of Mexico . . . &quot;\n<br>\nIllustrative of how Juarez reciprocated Lincoln's friendly attitude was his response to an ill-advised overture he received from the Confederate government. The South had sent a delegation, under John T. Pickett, to try and win over the juaristas, Juarez, to put it mildly, sent the Confederates a message--throwing Pickett into a Mexico City jail for thirty days and then expelling him from the country.\n\n</p>","source":""},{"id":"powusa18571861","title":"Buchanan's Failures","type":"power","loc":"usa1","start":1857,"end":1861,"entry":"<p class=\"entry shen\">\nPresident James Buchanan tries <br>\nrepeatedly to interest Congress <br>\nin buying Cuba, but Congress is<br>\ntoo bitterly divided over slavery.</p>","source":""},{"id":"powmex1858","title":"","type":"power","loc":"mex1","start":1858,"end":1858,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">Benito Juarez (1806-72) is elected president of Mexico</p>","source":""},{"id":"powarg1859","title":"","type":"power","loc":"arg1","start":1859,"end":1859,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">Buenos Aires is compelled to rejoin Argentina</p>","source":""},{"id":"powmex1861","title":"","type":"power","loc":"mex1","start":1861,"end":1861,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">French, British, and spanish troops land in Mexico in a dispute over loan repayments.</p>","source":""},{"id":"redstarjam1865","title":"","type":"redstar","loc":"jam1","start":1865,"end":1865,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">In the Morant Bay Rebellion, Afro-Jamaicans who had been freed from slavery in the 1830s seek the social equality that is still denied them.</p>","source":""},{"id":"econeur1867","title":"Concentration of Wealth / Plundered Areas","type":"economy","loc":"eur1","start":1867,"end":1867,"entry":"<p class=\"entry\">Marx writes in Chapter 3 of the first volume of Capital: \n<blockquote>\n&quot;The discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signalized the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production.

As the money economy extended, more and more social strata and regions of the world became involved in unequal exchange. Ernest Mandel has added up the value of the gold and silver torn from Latin America up to 1660, the booty extracted from Indonesia by the Dutch East India Company from 1650 to 1780, the harvest reaped by French capital in the eighteenth-century slave trade, the profits from slave labor in the  British Antilles and from\na half-century of British looting in India. The total exceeds the capital invested in all European industrial enterprises operated by steam in about 1800. This enormous mass of capital, Mandel notes, created a favorable climate for investment in Europe, stimulated the &quot;spirit of enterprise,&quot; and directly financed the establishment of manufactures, which in turn gave a strong thrust to the Industrial Revolution. </p><p class=\"entry\">But at the same time the formidable international concentration of wealth for Europe's benefit prevented the jump into the accumulation of industrial capital in the plundered areas: “The double tragedy of the developing countries consists in the fact that they were not only victims of that process of international concentration, but that subsequently they have had to try and compensate for their industrial backwardness—that is, realize the primitive accumulation of industrial capital—in a world flooded with articles manufactured by an already mature industry, that of the West.”</p>","source":"Open Veins of Latin America"},{"id":"cultnic18691916","title":"Ruben Dario 1869-1916","type":"culture","loc":"nic1","start":1867,"end":1916,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">Ruben Dario, the founder of the modernismo literary movement, publishes great works that help begin a century of acclaimed Nicaraguan poetry.

Over time, the Indian society lost its military coloration as Moravian missionaries from Bethlehem, PA, and American and British companies like Standard Fruit moved into the area. Along with the foreign companies and the missionaries came small businessmen-many of them Britons, Germans, and Americans-who settled in the interior of the Rio Coco. They settled into the region, married Indian women, and set up trading posts, ranches, boat yards, and lumber supply areas along the river. These people, called &quot;bamboo whites&quot; by the Marines, shipped raw wood from inside Nicaragua to sawmills located at Puerto Cabezas on the coast. Both politically and economically, they would prove critical in the war with Sandino.\n<br>\nAs a result of all these developments-missionary activity, the development of foreign owned &quot;big businesses&quot; along the coast, and the addition of a new strata of &quot;bamboo businessmen&quot; to the area's social structure-the Miskito remained more connected to the United States and the English-speaking Caribbean than to Hispanic Nicaragua. But if local history and economics pushed the coast in one direction, geopolitics moved it in another. Backed by pressure from the United States, Great Britain dropped the coast from protectorate status and officially ceded the area to Nicaragua in 1860. Since Nicaragua was too weak to exercise its claim, the coast remained in political limbo for decades until Nicaraguan President Jose Santos Zelaya sent troops into the area to capture Bluefields in 1894.\n<br>\nDespite military occupation by Spanish-speaking troops, the Indians continued to resent the Nicaraguans. The inhabitants of the coast also kept looking to Great Britain for support (several British and American businessmen did sell them arms).  In 1894, the Miskito Reserve was dissolved — &quot;reincorporated&quot; into the Nicaraguan state — which led to a local uprising that was eventually quelled by the US Marines. \n<br>\nIn the years following the 1894 takeover, Black Creoles and Miskito Indians would pepper the British Foreign Office with petitions that asked the British to retake their territory, a tradition that would continue until the late 1950s.

In\r1896 marines attacked Corimo to 'protect American interests during\rpolitical unrest'; in 1898 US troops landed at San Juan del Sur; in 1899\rthey were in action in Bluefields and San Juan del Norte, all under the\rrubric of 'protecting American lives and bridges'. Nicaraguans should\rhave understood by this time that people in Washington, not Managua,\rwould control their destiny.\n<br>\nNevertheless, some Nicaraguans took sovereignty seriously. In the\rearly 1900s Nicaraguan President Jose Samos Zelaya (who assumed\rdictatorial powers) committed a bold and, as it turned out, rather\rimprudent act. This crusty authoritarian nationalist refused to cede to\rthe United States exclusive rights to build a canal, which would have\rincluded US control of a strip of Nicaraguan territory. Instead, he invited\rEuropean and Japanese concerns to aid in building an interoceanic link\rto connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. He also asked the Bank of\rEngland - not a New York bank - for a loan.\r<br>\rUS Secretary of State Philander C. Knox took umbrage. Highly\rconscious of the Monroe Doctrine and the Roosevelt Corrolary to\rthat document, which asserted US 'international police power' in the\rhemisphere, Knox branded Zelaya's moves as opening the door to\r'European infiltration'. He angrily denounced the Nicaraguan president\rfor even daring to think about entering into financial transactions With\rany but US banks. Knox's subsequent demands on the Nicaraguan\rgovernment belied even the thinnest respect for its sovereignty: a ninety-nine\ryear lease for a naval base on the Gulf of Fonseca and permanent\raccess rights for a canal through Nicaragua. In words that presaged\rReagan administration rhetoric some seventy years later, Philander Knox,\rin 1909, accused Zelaya of 'keeping Central America in tension and\rturmoil'.\n<br>\rThe stubborn Zelaya, taking seriously the fiction of Nicaraguan\rindependence, refused to accede to Knox's commands. The US government retaliated by destabilizing his regime. During the course of\rsubverting Zelaya's government, two US secret agents were caught <i>in\rflagrante delicto</i> trying to dynamite Nicaraguan bridges. Zelaya ordered\rthem to be tried. Despite US protestations, they were convicted and\rshot. Knox used the incident to sever diplomatic relations and send\rmarines to Bluefields.\n<br>\rKnox's plan worked. As was the case in subsequent episodes of\rdestablization, the government and the private sector cooperated. United\rFruit Company donated $1 million toward the overthrow of the Zelaya\rgovernment. Zelaya was forced into exile and replaced by Adolfo Diaz\rwho, obedient to Washington's commands, canceled concessions to\rnon-US firms and opened the door to the exaggerated claims of US\rbanks, which then transferred to their own coffers more than half of\rNicaragua's national bank assets. In 1914, as the Panama Canal opened\rto ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific, President Diaz made\ran offer to the United States: S3 million in exchange for 'rights in\nperpetuity' to any land needed to build a canal through the San Juan\rroute in southern Nicaragua. The $3 million was handled by US-appointed\rcommissioners to repay foreign loans, mostly to US banks,\rso that a mere pittance actually found its way into the Nicaraguan\rTreasury. The canal was never built, but the United States acquired a\rrenewable lease for a naval base on the Corn Islands and on the Gulf\rof Fonseca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>","source":"THE GUERRILLA WARS \r\nOF CENTRAL AMERICA, Saul Landau "},{"id":"redstarmex19101920","title":"Limited Impacts","type":"redstar","loc":"mex2","start":1910,"end":1920,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">Mexican Revolution In Chiapas, the fight is over control of land and indigenous labor.

The hit-and-run guerrilla war tactics of Augusto Sandino, who\rbetween 1927 and 1933 fought the U.S. Marines in Nicaragua to a\rdraw, further taught them that political nationalism was an equally\rpowerful force and that attempts to counter it with increased militarism\rwould only lead to a deterioration of American influence.\rU.S. troops had been in and out of Nicaragua a number of times\rsince the late nineteenth century. In 1916 Calvin Coolidge, who despite\rhis charisma deficit fancied himself a robust expansionist in the\rTheodore Roosevelt mold, once again dispatched an expedition, this\rtime to quell a budding civil war but also to sequester the kind of\rrevolutionary nationalism that was spreading throughout Mexico.\rHis actions backfired.\r<br>\rDespite overwhelming asymmetrical firepower, including advances\rin aerial warfare, Nicaragua proved to be the United States's\rfirst third-world quagmire. Sandino harassed the Americans not just\rwith attack-and-retreat guerrilla tactics that inflicted a deadly toll\rbut with ideas. As head of a self-styled Defending Army of Nicaraguan\rNational Sovereignty, the rebel leader̵who took as his official seal\ran image of a peasant with a raised machete about to decapitate a\rcaptured marine—tapped into widespread Latin American resentment.\rHis brand of patriotism esteemed the dark-skinned, impoverished\rpeasant culture that prevailed throughout Mesoamerica md\rmuch of South America, while vilifying not only Yankees but their\rwell-heeled local allies, or, as Sandino called them, vendepatrias—country\rsellers. &quot;Pro-Nicaraguan committees&quot; sprang up throughout\rLatin America, with Sandino's David-against-Goliath struggle\rcoming to embody a century of aggression and arrogance. Manifestos,\n\ngrassroots meetings, editorials, and ever larger street protests denounced Washington's war in Nicaragua. Newspapers published\rregular articles on the crisis and ran photographs provided by\rSandino of captured, executed, and mutilated marines, contributing\rto a sense of U.S. vulnerability. His appeal extended to the United\rStates, where he coordinned his public relations campaign with the\ractivities of the All-American Anti-Imperialist League, sending his\rbrother Socrates on a national speaking tour. In Europe, a Mexican\rdelegate to the 1929 International Congress against Colonialism and\rImperialism waved a tattered American flag captured by Sandino's\rtroops to a loud round of cheers and applause. Even London, then\rin the process of spreading its control over much of the Middle East,\rtook great pleasure re in condemning America's actions as &quot;frankly imperialistic.&quot;\n<br>\rTensions came to a head at the Sixth Pan-American Conference,\rheld in Havana in early 1928. By the time of the meeting, panAmericanism,\rthe idea that the American republics shared common\rideals and political interests, was in effect moribund. But it was trotted out every few years in an international forum where Latin American delegates mostly submitted to Washington's directives while\rsilently seething about the latest violation of national sovereignty—in Panama, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Venezuela, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, take your pick. Proceedings in Havana moved according to script. The closing ceremony was not intended\rfor debate, yet El Salvador raised the issue of Washington's military\rinterventions, opening the floodgates of criticism. The gallery audience\rapplauded each recounting of old and new grievances and\rhissed at the tepid defense of US. policy offered by its envoy. This\rcourt rebellion took place in the shadow of Sandino's war, which\ron the eve of the conference had scored a number of impressive\rvictories. The rebel was not directly mentioned, although one Latin\rAmerican daily after another read the diplomacy in light of the\rfighting in Nicaragua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>","source":"Empire's Workshop, Greg Grandin"},{"id":"pownic1912","title":"","type":"power","loc":"pan1","start":1912,"end":1912,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">1912 Marines land during heated election.</p>","source":""},{"id":"powusa1912","title":"Virtue","type":"power","loc":"usa1","start":1912,"end":1912,"entry":"<p class=\"entry shen\">President Howard Taft: &quot;The whole hemisphere will be ours in fact as, by virtue of our superiority of race, it already is ours morally.&quot;</p>","source":""},{"id":"econarg1913","title":"National City Bank","type":"economy","loc":"arg1","start":1913,"end":1913,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">National City Bank (now Citibank) opens its first South American branch, after having financed projects by US firms like General Electric there and elsewhere in the continent.</p>","source":""},{"id":"econusa1913","title":"Concessions","type":"economy","loc":"usa1","start":1913,"end":1913,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">President Woodrow Wilson observed: &quot;You hear of 'concessions' to foreign capitalists in Latin America.

Nor in Paraguay, as we have seen;\rbut the railroads built by the Paraguayan state, with the help of European\rtechnicians, passed into British hands after the defeat. The other countries'\rrailroads went the same way without producing a single centavo of new\rinvestment; furthermore, the state contracts took care to assure the companies a\rminimum profit level, to avoid possible unpleasant surprises. Decades later, at\rthe end of World War II, when the railroads yielded no more dividends and had\rfallen into relative disuse, the public authorities got them back. Almost all of\rthe states bought the scrap iron from the British and thus nationalized the\rcompanies' losses.\n<br>\rWhen the railroads were booming, the British concerns had often obtained\rconsiderable land concessions on either side of the tracks, in addition to the\rrailbeds themselves and the right to build new branch lines. The land was an\radditional business bonanza. A fabulous gift to the Brazilian railway in 1911\rled to the burning of countless huts and the eviction or death of peasant\rfamilies in the concession area. It was this that triggered off the &quot;Contestado&quot;\rrevolt, one of the greatest outbursts of popular fury in Brazilian history.</i>\n<br>\nThe Contestado movement occurred in the south of the country in a\rfrontier area disputed by the states of Parana and Santa Catarina. It began\rin 1911 under the leadership of Jose Maria, who died in the first clashes\rand was heralded as a saint by the rebels of the Contestado. Unlike\rCanudos, the movement did not limit itself to one particular centre, but\rshifted to various points in the region, under pressure from military\rforces. The rebellion was put down in late 1915, when rebel strongholds\rwere attacked and destroyed by 6,000 soldiers from the army and the\rpolice force, assisted by 1,000 civilians who joined in the process of\rrepression.\n<br>\nIn considering the principal social movements in the interior of Brazil\rduring the First Republic, Joazeiro, a city in the south of the state of\rCeara, which became the centre of activities of the priest Cicero Romao\rBatista between 1872 and 1924, also deserves mention. There are many\rcommon features between events in Joazeiro and the Canudos and\rContestado movements. For example, from the point of view of the\rhistory of the transformation of the Catholic church in Brazil, particularly\rin the north-east, Canudos and Joazeiro were manifestations of similar developments.\rOn the other hand, when considering social movements as\rmanifestations of rebellion, Joazeiro has little in common with the other\rtwo movements. Although Padre Cicero clashed continuously with the\recclesiastical authorities, and at times with factions of the oligarchy, his\rmovement for better or worse fell within the system of domination\rwhich prevailed during the First Republic. Put simply, the city of\rJoazeiro can be seen as an area controlled by a <i>priest-coronel</i>, who had a\rconsiderable degree of influence within the political oligarchy, particularly\rafter 1909 when Padre Cicero began to involve himself directly in\rthe political struggles.\n<br>\rThe Canudos and Contestado movements were attempts to create an\nalternative way of life, and were considered sufficiently dangerous for\rboth to be brutally crushed by military forces. This does not mean that\rthey were totally opposed to the power structure of the coronets. Before\rsettling in Canudos, Antonio Conselheiro had been a practising member\rof the Catholic church, living an ascetic, nomadic life. He summoned\rthe people together in order to build or rebuild churches. He built\rwalls around cemeteries, and he showed concern for the small parish\rchurches of the interior. There is evidence that at this stage he was well\rlooked upon by certain coronets, for whom his disciplined followers built\rroads and dams. The village of Canudos itself did not depart very much\rfrom the traditional pattern of settlement in the interior. There was a\rcertain degree of social and economic differentiation, a considerable\rdegree of trade with the surrounding area, and religious links with the\rpriests of the neighbouring parishes. Canudos was also a source of votes\rand influence at election time.\n<br>\rThe instigators of the Contesdado movement were the followers of a\rcoronet who was a member of the opposition and seen as a friend of the\rpoor. Others of varying origins joined this group, among them those\rwho were the victims of the process of modernization in both urban and\rrural areas: rural workers driven off the land by the construction of a\rrailway and a timber plant, people who had been recruited for railway\rconstruction from among the unemployed of large cities and then\rabandoned at the end of their contract, and criminals who were at large in\rthe region. However, the village settlements which grew up during the\rContestado, with their emphasis on equality and fraternity, clashed with\restablished social values, and assumed characteristics which were clearly\rmessianic. This can be seen, among other features, through the way\rmany of the members of the Contestado remained loyal to the monarchy\rwhich, it has been argued, represented an eschatological kingdom more\rthan a political institution. The theme of the monarchy, whether\rbecause of the form it took or because of the period in which the\rContestado movement occurred, was not exploited to any extent by the\rgovernment. In contrast, the earlier monarchism of Antonio\rConselheiro, with its attacks on the Republic, responsible for the\rintroduction of civil marriage and for the taking of cemeteries away from\rthe control of the church, took more concrete forms. As a result it was a\rmobilizing factor against Canudos in the urban centres, at a time when\nthe possibility of the restoration of the monarchy was seen as a real threat.\rCanudos, Contestado and Joazeiro were not episodes devoid of\rsignificance, nor were they isolated expressions by an ignorant rural\rpopulation in contrast to the centres of civilization on the coast. In\rdifferent degrees, these movements can be linked to changes in the\rCatholic church, to socio-economic changes in their respective areas, and\rto the political development of the nation itself. Their particular strength\ras a demonstration of popular religious belief cannot be ignored.\rNevertheless, as attempts at independent organization on the part of the\rrural population, they effectively illustrate the severe limitations of such\rorganization during the period of the First Republic.\n</p>","source":""},{"id":"econhai1914","title":"The US Marines and the Haitian Bank","type":"economy","loc":"hai1","start":1914,"end":1914,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">U.S. Marines loot the National Bank of Port Au Prince, Haiti</p><p class=\"entry \">history.state.gov/milestones/1914-1920/Haiti</p>","source":""},{"id":"powhai19141934","title":"19-year Occupation After Revolts","type":"power","loc":"hai1","start":1914,"end":1934,"entry":"<p class=\"entry columns3\">1914-34<br>\nU.S. troops occupy to prevent Rosalvo Bobo, known for his anti-U.S. positions, from becoming president.

Strikes became more disruptive as industry attempted to deal with\nmaterial shortages caused by World War I. The war disrupted coal imports\nfrom England, forcing industry to operate at reduced levels. Railway\ncompanies struggled to maintain schedules while imports plunged. Real\nwages fell between 1914 and 1917 by a third as shortages forced industries\nto dismiss workers. Use of agricultural wastes compressed into briquettes\nfor heating and cooking symbolized wartime hardships and the decline\nin living standards. Frustrated workers clashed with factory owners\nas strikes became violent. Employers with links with vigilante groups\nformed the Labor Association (Asociacion del Trabajo) to break strikes with\nreplacement workers. The meatpacking strike of December 1917 ended\nbloodily, as the police stormed union headquarters armed with sabers\nslashing anyone unlucky enough to be in the way. A railroad strike earlier\nin the year resulted in damaged and burned equipment. The government\nusually intervened against strikes mounted by supposed radicals,\nwhile moderate union leaders often received President Yrigoyen's support. In the\ncase of the rail strike the president imposed a generous contract on the\ncompanies, including an eight-hour day, annual paid vacations, and sick\nand overtime pay. Yrigoyen's tactics undercut the Socialists and pushed\nthe Anarchists into confrontation, with grim consequences. Two violent\nclashes, the January 1919 Semana Tragica (Tragic Week) and the Patagonia\nTragica (1921-1922), rank among the worst labor disturbances of the early\ntwentieth century.\n<br>\nThe Semana Tragica began with a strike against a metalwork factory by\nan Anarchist union late in 1918. Fighting broke out between strikebreakers\nand workers. Heavy-handed police tactics added to the violence.\nOver the course of the next several diays, events spun out of control. \nThe Anarchist Labor Federntion's call for a genernl strike provided the pretext\nfor vigilantes, who subsequently provided the core of Liga Patriotica\nArgentina (Argentine Patriotic League). Thugs swept into the Jewish\nbarrio of Buenos Aires (popular perceptions associated Jews with\nAnarchists) and by the time the destruction ended, 700 to 1,500 people\ndied and another 4,000 had been beaten or injured. The army, without\norders from the president, assumed control of the capital.

In the end, an alarmed\ngovernment forced the company to settle the strike. Lingering police and\nvigilante violence slowly played itself out and the Semana Tragica ended.\nUpper class perceptions that the government lacked the will or ability to\ndiscipline workers resul ted in the forma tion of the Liga Patriotica Argentina.\nThe LPA responded to fears that foreign ideologies, and labor organiziltions\ninfluenced by them, would shred the social fabric and damage the\neconomy. Manuel Carles established the League in 1919 with the idea of\nusing physical force to root out radicals. Organized as a paramilitary organization,\nthe LPA drew much of its leadership from the Jockey Club. The\nleague's mission to indoctrinate the working class to counter radicalism\nhad the support of the Church, the elite, and the middle class. A female\ndivision labored to bring the League's message to working-women. While\nthe upper and middle classes becnme more concerned, labor became\nincreasingly desperate and militant.\n<br>\nIn Patagonia, violence came on the heels of a momentary improvement\nin working conditions. In late 1920, employers, mainly British sheep operators,\norganized as the Sociedad Rural de Santa Cruz, responded positively\nto demands for better wnges and conditions. Workers wanted a limit\non the number of occupants per hut, a mattress for each person, and\nsalaries in hard currency to protect the value of wages. Unfortunately, a\ndrop in the price of wool on world markets led to deterioration of labor\nand living conditions. A general strike drew a sharp line between owners\nand workers. The issue cnme down to which side would bear the\nburden of hard times. Angry workers seized property, while landowners\nformed white guards to defend their interests. Local Radical party officials\nsided with the owners. Unbalanced reports picked up by the press\npresented an alarmist and distorted picture. After local muscle failed to\nbreak the strike, the army arrived in early 1921, believing that it faced an\nAnarchist insurrection. The Tenth Cavalry, commanded by Lt. Colonel\nHector Varela assisted by LPA members, shot suspected Anarchists in\ncold blood, tortured strikers, and dumped their bodies into mass graves.\nAfter some 2,000 victims, the strike collapsed.

After the Medellin Council of Latin American Bishops in 1968, Ruiz begins to promote liberation theology and an indigenous-centered Catholicism.\n</p><p class=\"entry columns3\" style=\"clear:both;font-size:small;background-color:#E8E8E8;top-padding:-50px;\">\nBishop Samuel Ruiz often said that, when he was appointed to the diocese in 1959, he found little or nothing had changed in the plight of the indigenous people since the time of Las Casas, nearly 500 years ago. His own life started in poverty: the eldest of 5 children, his parents struggled to survive on a shared smallholding and a little grocery shop in Irapuato, in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato. Schooled irregular at first, in part because of stringent laws against Catholics and their schools in the 1930s post-revolutionary era of persecution of the Mexican Church. At the age of 13, however, things changed when he joined the diocesan minor seminary, even though it was not strictly legal at the time and had no fixed abode. He subsequently had a brilliant early career in the Church, going from the seminary in Mexico to ordination, postgraduate studies and a doctorate in biblical studies in Rome after World War II. On his return to Mexico he became firstly a teacher, then rector of the diocesan seminary in León and subsequently a canon of León Cathedral, before being made Bishop of San Cristobal at the early age of 35.\n<br>\nWhen he arrived in Chiapas, the state seemed stuck in its past, but the Church in Latin America had begun a process of change, still moving today, although the new bishop was not initially aware of the shape this was taking. The Council of Latin American Bishops (CELAM) met for the first time in Rio de Janeiro in 1955 and the Catholic Church on the sub-continent started to bring together its experiences. Ruiz first followed his predecessor in encouraging the work of catechists, who by their service and the example of their own lives inspired the rest of the community. Later, he criticized this approach for its orientation towards Western attitudes and organization from the top down rather than from among the people themselves using their own cultural values. This comment comes from what is really his own testament to his work, the pastoral letter he wrote to his diocese on the occasion of the visit of Pope John Paul II to the south of Mexico in August 1993, En Esta Hora de Gracia (‘In This Hour of Grace’).\n<br>\nFrom this and other sources one can sketch what Don Samuel considered to be his own growth in understanding, his ‘conversion’ as he himself called it. He was at the Second Vatican Council and was impressed by the part played by the bishops from Africa in putting together the decree, Ad Gentes about the Church's missionary activity. They were lobbying strongly for a new approach to Christian anthropology, he said on a radio program in his retirement, which would help them more with their missionary work and value the dignity of different cultures. He referred often to the influence that Ad Gentes had on him at a time when he says he himself was still thinking of ways to teach his people to substitute Spanish for their own indigenous languages in order to evangelize them and help them economically. He began to see more clearly that the Spanish missionaries had not come just to evangelize but also to impose their culture. And now here was Ad Gentes, advising Christians to familiarize themselves with their own national and religious traditions and seek out the seeds of The Word that lay latent within these.\n<br>\nThe ‘conversion’ did not stop there. In 1968, CELAM's second conference in Medellín, Colombia, looked at ways of making Vatican II more readily applicable to the Latin American context. There was a dramatic refocusing towards the widespread misery on the sub-continent, resulting from unjust social and economic structures which the poor were powerless to change. This attention to ‘institutionalised violence’, made a profound impression. So the catechists in Don Samuel’s diocese became the spokespeople of their communities, which were considering all aspects – social, political, economic and cultural – of their situation in order to work out where the Spirit of God was leading them.\n<br>\nThe next point of departure on Don Samuel’s road was the 1974 Congress of the Indigenous he held in San Cristobal. The communities had elected speakers whom they felt led straight lives and could represent them. The catechists of the diocese now were not just there to help with traditional catechetics, with services and singing, but were genuine representatives of their communities in all the matters most important to them. There followed three days of lament for all the abuses that the indigenous peoples had suffered, with details, but also concrete suggestions about what to do in each case. By then, Don Samuel could speak two of the four languages of the indigenous present with a working knowledge of the others. He learned enough at the meeting to see the inadequacy of his diocesan pastoral plan, which he scrapped there and then and developed another based on what he had heard.\n<br>\nThe 1979 third conference of CELAM in Puebla, Mexico reinforced Don Samuel’s thinking through its advice to the Church to pursue a path of preferential option for the poor, including the 75 per cent of the people of the diocese of San Cristobal who were indigenous as well as many of those who were not. He quoted the Book of Exodus as a start in trying to help his people follow this directive: ‘I have seen the miserable state of my people in Egypt. I have heard their appeal to be free of their slave drivers. Yes, I am well aware of their sufferings.’ He also had something to say to the rest of us, interpreting St Matthew: ‘Men are blessed when, moved by the Spirit of God, they show solidarity with the poor.’\n<br>\nIt was the fourth conference of CELAM, at Santo Domingo in 1992 that in many ways satisfied Don Samuel most. In the final document’s reflections on the indigenous peoples, he explain why. ‘The action of God, through his Spirit, is present within all cultures’. ‘One task of evangelization, conducted in terms of the culture, will always be the salvation and comprehensive liberation of a particular people or human group’. Don Samuel’s growing belief and commitment of the previous 30 years now had the unequivocal backing of the Church. The Church had answered the question, at least in theory, once posed to him by one of his people: ‘If the Church does not make itself Tzeltal with the Tzeltal people, or Ch’ol with the Ch’ol people or Tojolobal with the Tojolobales, how can it call itself Catholic?’\n\n\n</p>","source":"Zapatista Timeline by Tom Hansen and Enlace Civil"},{"id":"powbra1961","title":"Bleeding the Brazilian Economy","type":"power","loc":"bra4","start":1961,"end":1961,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">Plans for a military coup were initiated shortly after João Goulart became President in August 1961.

Hoping to professionalize Guatemala's intelligence system, Longan and other American advisors centralized the operations of the police and military, training them to gather, analyze and act on intelligence in a coordinated and rapid manner. Longan identified a need for &quot;fundamental elementary work in organization, coordination, and basic police activity.&quot; On December 5, he held the first in a series of workshops with the heads of the Judicial and National Police, military officers, including Colonel Rafael Arriaga Bosque, and two other US public safety advisors. Longan laid out plans for combined &quot;overt&quot; and &quot;covert&quot; operations collectively called &quot;Operacion Limpieza&quot; - Operation Cleanup. In the overt phase of the operation, the &quot;Army, the Judicial Police, and the National Police&quot; would carry out sweeps in &quot;suspect areas in hope that some criminal or subversive elements could be caught in net and lead to further openings.&quot; Longan instructed the officers in a maneuver dubbed the &quot;frozen area plan,&quot; which entailed the cordoning off a four block radius, establishing an outer perimeter, and searching the secured area for subversives and information. On the covert side, Longan recommended the creation of a small &quot;action unit to mastermind campaign against terrorists which would have access to all information from law enforcement agencies. . . .&quot; A team of &quot;trusted investigators&quot; would work from a &quot;special room to be called 'The Box,'&quot; a 24-hour nerve center equipped with telecommunications and electronic surveillance equipment staffed by military colonels and captains and located at Matamoros, the military's general headquarters in downtown Guatemala City. Responsibility for the full operation, including command of &quot;The Box,&quot; was given to Arriaga Bosque, the commanding officer of Matamoros. The overt and covert sides of the proposed operation complemented each other. Intelligence picked up from wide sweeps using the frozen area plan was to be sent to 'The Box' to be analyzed and deployed in more focused clandestine raids, which in turn would provide information for larger dragnets.\n<br>\nEquipped with state of the art telecommunications and surveillance equipment and operating out of military headquarters, Arriaga began to carry out widespread raids. By the end of February, eighty operations—and a number of extrajudicial executions—had taken place. Then between March 3 and March 5, Operacion Limpieza netted its largest catch. On March 2, the military and police picked up three guerrilla leaders. On the third, the police captured Leonardo Leonardo Castillo Flores, who headed the national peasant union under Arbenz, and three \n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"virtualpage3 hidepiece columns\">\nother PGT-FAR members on the south coast. The next day, the fourth, special security officers from Guatemala City arrived to interrogate the prisoners, which according to a CIA document apparently yielded information on Guatemala City safe houses. The following day, the police and military detained a number of PGT leaders, including Victor Manuel Gutierrez - the head of the national labor union under Arbenz. <img src=\"http://hiaw.org/defcon2/mapimages/victormanuelgutierrez.jpg\">By March 5, security forces had captured scores of members of the PGT, FAR, and MR-13 (a Trotskist split from the FAR) in coordinated operations throughout the country, including the capital and the southern coast. The oft stated US goal of effective use of intelligence and coordinated operations between police and military and between the countryside and the city was now a reality.\n<br>\nJudicial Police took Gutierrez to their downtown headquarters, where they submitted him to a torture dubbed la capucha. They covered his head with cowl and shocked him with electric currents, which according to one witness quickly proved too much for Gutierrez, who suffered from a frail heart. Security forces transferred most of the rest of those captured in Guatemala City to the Matamoros military base, where 'The Box' was located. They were interrogated, tortured, executed, and their bodies placed in sacks and dropped into the Pacific. Years later, Longan recalled that some of their remains washed back onto shore. The exact number is not known, but, along with Castillo Flores and Gutierrez, the police and military murdered at least thirty people over the course of four days. In July, a defector from the national police told the newspaper El Grafico that execution orders came from Arriaga Bosque, the man in charge of the new US &quot;action unit.&quot; US embassy officials admitted that the killings were carried out under the auspices of Operacion Limpieza. The embassy's March progress report, which enumerated its paragraphs, stated in paragraph number four that the Guatemalan government scored &quot;a considerable success when they captured a number of leading Communists, including Victor Manuel Gutierrez [and] Leonardo Castillo Flores.&quot; Paragraph twenty-three then matter-of-factly noted that the police &quot;have conducted 80 raids during the past month using the 'frozen area plan'. The raids have been productive in apprehensions (see paragraph 4).&quot; Despite pleas from Guatemala's archbishop and over 500 petitions of habeas corpus filed by relatives, the government and the American Embassy remained silent about the fate of the executed.\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"source\">Greg Grandin</p>","source":"Greg Grandin"},{"id":"powarg1966","title":"Installed, Dissolved, Banned","type":"power","loc":"arg1","start":1966,"end":1966,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">On June 28, prior to the provincial elections in Buenos Aires, a military junta overthrows Illia, imposes a Revolutionary Statute that is superior to the Constitution, and installs Ongania in the presidency.

Buenos Aires, 1936), in collaboration with other Argentine filmmakers, filmed a chapter of Argentina, mayo de 1969: los caminos de la liberación. The film has never been restored in its entirety, and few have seen it. Nevertheless, it remains a legendary testimony to collective political unrest, particularly influential for its promotion of cinema as a new vehicle of protest against a ruling regime.\nSolanas’ filmic inspirations were not exclusively cinematic: his earlier studies in literature, music, dance and law led him to pursue theater arts at the Conservatory of Dramatic Arts (Conservatorio de Arte Dramático), where cinema would eventually seduce him. His career in cinema began at age 26, with the filming of Seguir andando (1962). Another short film, Reflexión ciudadana (1963), followed a year later. \nLike his friend Octavio Getino, Solanas was a Peronist, and in 1968 the two men directed the most influential political documentary of the era: La hora de los hornos: Notas y testimonios sobre el neocolonialismo, la violencia y la liberación. Divided into three parts, the 255-minute documentary managed to be many things at once: instrument of leftist political and social protest; manifesto; educational cinematic debate; essay of cultural interpretation of Latin America in general and of Argentina in particular; a filmic collage, collecting and juxtaposing fragments from other films of the period; active artifact in the democratization of images; unofficial history. It was also the most controversial film of the 1960s.  \n<br>\nSolanas and Getino also founded the Grupo Cine Liberación and developed the theory of “Third Cinema”: a cinema that is neither commercial nor authorial, emerging instead from the public at large. Meanwhile, the two kept in close contact with Juan Domingo Perón during his exile in Madrid (1955-1974), following his removal from power in the so-called Liberating Revolution (Revolución Libertadora). The relationship resulted in their 1971 film, Perón: Actualización política y doctrinaria para la toma del poder. \n<br>\nSolanas’ second full-length film, Los hijos de Fierro (1972), appropriated a well-known literary character in order to experiment with combining scenes of fiction and documentary. This innovation achieves an extremely personal reading of Martín Fierro, the classic “gauchesco” poem of 1872. Adding to the film’s unique ambition, much of the dialogue is written in the same octosyllabic meter as José Hernández’s poem. Given the poem’s fundamental role in Argentine culture, it becomes a poignant frame of reference and brilliant backdrop for a complex film that oscillates between epic and lyric, realist and mythic, allowing the poem’s “characters” and scenarios to articulate a political allegory of the 1970s in Argentina.  \nIn 1975, the military executed another coup d’etat in Argentina. The following year, Solanas went into exile. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<font style=\"display:none\">\n\n\n\n\nGrupo Cine Liberacion, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, Cine Base Formed (1973), letters from Peron</font></p>","source":""},{"id":"indbra1968","title":"The Indians and the Land","type":"ind","loc":"bra8","start":1968,"end":1968,"entry":"<p class=\"entry columns\">At the beginning of [the twentieth century] 230 tribes survived in Brazil; since then ninety have disappeared, erased from the planet by firearms and microbes.

They embarked on a process of collecting archive material—newsreels—and recording testimonies of militants of the so-called Peronist Resistance (a period of popular struggles beginning with Peron's fall in 1955), of intellectuals and university leaders. This search made the filmmakers travel all over the country and was reflected in the film's subtitle, 'Notes and Testimonies on Neocolonialism, Violence and Liberation'.\n<br>\nThroughout this process (from late 1965 to mid-1968), the directors gradually modified their original proposal and part of their ideas. They incorporated the revisionist view of history and a look on the Peronist working class as the main subject of Argentina's revolutionary transformation. They experienced, as well as many other intellectuals in those years, a journey from the traditional left into a national left. With a new military regime coming to power in 1966, because of the film's adhesion to proscribed Peronism and in particular to its most radicalised wing, its revolutionary proposals and the will to inscribe it into the struggles for social change, they had to resort to an alternative exhibition circuit.\n<br>\nThe formal organisation of La Hora de los Hornos is inextricably linked to these objectives. Its total running time of four hours 15 minutes is structured into three parts, each with a different formal treatment, theme and even objective. The first section, 'Neocolonialism and Violence', was conceived as an essay film, which discusses the neocolonial nature of Argentine and Latin American dependency through 13 chapters. The second part, 'Act for Liberation', is divided in two, reflecting specific time periods: Chronicle of Peronism and Chronicle of Resistance. Conceived as a film act and dedicated to the 'Peronist proletarians', these two chronicles respectively deal with an analysis of the ten years of Peronism in power (1946-55) and a critical reconstruction of the ensuing struggles (1956-66). The third part, 'Violence and Liberation', dedicated to 'the new man who is being born out of this liberation war', presents itself as a study on the meaning of violence.

In a word, it democratises. The film-maker's tie with reality makes him more a part of his people. Vanguard layers and even masses participate collectively in the work when they realise that it is the continuity of their daily struggle. La hora de los hornos shows how a film can be made in hostile circumstances when it has the support and collaboration of militants and cadres from the people.\n<br>\n&quot;The revolutionary film-maker acts with a radically new vision of the role of the producer, team-work, tools, details, etc. Above all, he supplies himself at all levels in order to produce his films, he equips himself at all levels, he learns how to handle the manifold techniques of his craft. His most valuable possessions are the tools of his trade, which form part and parcel of his need to communicate. The camera is the inexhaustible expropriator of image-weapons; the projector, a gun that can shoot 24 frames per second.&quot; —Directors Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino &quot;Towards a Third Cinema&quot;\n</p>","source":""},{"id":"powarg1969","title":"Cordobazo","type":"power","loc":"arg1","start":1969,"end":1969,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">Military ruler Juan Carlos Ongania instituted a wave of repression against leftists and unions by the DIPA secret police, cut union rights and rolled back labor gains.

Once again, the US was well-positioned to use Brazil as a &quot;testing area for modern scientific methods of industrial development&quot; (Haines), and therefore has every right to take credit for what ensued. Under US guidance, Brazil pursued orthodox neoliberal policies, &quot;doing everything right&quot; by monetarist criteria, and &quot;strengthening the market economy&quot; (Skidmore). The &quot;economic miracle&quot; proceeded in parallel with the entrenchment of the fascist National Security State, not accidentally; a regime that could not wield the knout could hardly have carried out measures with such a deleterious impact on the population. <br>\nThe President announced in 1970 that repression would be &quot;harsh and implacable,&quot; with no rights for &quot;pseudo-Brazilians.&quot; Torture became &quot;a grisly ritual, a calculated onslaught against body and soul,&quot; Skidmore writes, with such specialties as torture of children and gang rape of wives before the family. The &quot;orgy of torture&quot; provided &quot;a stark warning&quot; to anyone with the wrong thoughts. It was a &quot;powerful instrument,&quot; that &quot;made it even easier for Delfim and his technocrats to avoid public debate over fundamental economic and social priorities&quot; while they &quot;preached the virtues of the free market.&quot; The resumption of high economic growth, by these means, made Brazil &quot;again attractive to foreign private investors,&quot; who took over substantial parts of the economy.

The Dominican Republic advertisement section in the New York Times of January 28, 1973, has a heading entitled &quot;Industrialists Dream of Chances Like These,&quot; featuring the low, low wage rates, running between 25 and 50 cents an hour. The ad stresses the role of the law in fixing hours and wages and allowing the free import of foreign technicians. There is no mention of any trade unions, but employers will properly read between the lines that unions have been broken and pacified (with the assistance of George Meany and the AFL-CIO). Of special interest is the regular use of government troops and police to break up independent unions. The agricultural union Sindicato Unido, which operated the fields now owned by G &amp; W was broken by police action in 1966 and 1967, and a number of its leaders, including the union lawyer Guido Gil were arrested and killed by the forces of law and order. \n<br>Another major foreign enterprise, Falconbridge Nickel, also successfully broke a union with army and police assistance in 1970. A Wall Street Journal report of September 9, 1971 states that &quot;when a union attempted to organize construction workers at a foreign-owned ferronickel mill project last year, Mr. Balaguer sent in the army to help straighten things out. While the soldiers kept order, the contractors fired 32 allegedly leftist leaders...The strike was broken in eight days.&quot; Matters had not changed much in the mid-70s. An ad hoc human rights group that visited the Dominican Republic in 1975 reported that &quot;working people have been prevented by nearly every conceivable means from forming and joining trade union organizations.&quot; A union organizing effort in the G &amp; W free trade zone in the mid-1970s was broken with the help of the police in arresting, jailing, and deporting labor organizers, and with the use of &quot;troops in full combat gear armed with submachine guns&quot; to break up organizing meetings. Flannery states that:\n<i>\n&quot;Officials of the Dominican labor ministry told organizers that—contrary to the paper guarantees of the republic's laws—workers would not be allowed to form a union in the industrial free zone.&quot;\n</i>\nOn the matter of labor unions, the 1977 State Department Human Rights Report has the following &quot;information&quot;: \n<i>\n&quot;Labor unions are permitted to function and numerous labor unions exist including some associated with opposition parties, but under some government controls.&quot;</i> That exhausts that topic.\n\n<br>In containing unions and rendering them docile the Dominican elite has had the steadfast support of the top echelons of the AFL-CIO, which has long cooperated closely with the CIA and international business firms in this unsavory operation.

Carter, because it was a matter\rof faith, made human rights a leitmotif of his foreign policy.\n<br>\n<img src=\"../mapimages/anastasiosomoza.jpg\" style=\"padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;\"><br>\n<span class=\"caption\">Anastasio (&quot;Tachito&quot;) Somoza</span>\n\n<br>\rSomoza was confused by Carter's apparent sincerity on the human\rrights issue. His family had been installed in power by President Franklin\rRoosevelt, the man who also had made human rights the center piece\nof US policy in his Four Freedoms address during World War II. But\rRoosevelt had never bothered the Somoza clan with complaints about\rhuman rights violations. After all, forty-five years of anti-communist\robedience should have counted for more than a few cases of maltreating\rradical trouble makers.\n<br>\rWhen Somoza finally realized that Carter was serious, he found\rhimself in an impossible position. To lift martial law for the purpose of\rcontinuing to receive US aid and legitimation would also mean allowing\rthe FSLN to have the necessary space to organize throughout the\rcountry. To abide by Carter's principles would require Somoza to leash\rand muzzle the National Guard; to remove from it the very instruments\rby which it had succeeded in terrorizing the population.\n<br>\rSomoza paid lip service to human rights, hoping that it would appease\rthe US ambassador, while at the same time he ordered the Guard to\rwipe out Sandinista influence in me poor barrios and the Christian\rbased communities where the priests and nuns were applying their\rrevolutionary theology. However, the ambassador did not turn the other\rway in 1977 and 1978 as Guard members murdered, tortured, raped\rand looted their way through the barrios and rural areas. US officials\rdenounced the abuses, threatened to cut off aid, and eventually did so\rin 1978. Subsequently writing from exile in Paraguay in the 1980s,\rSomoza charged: 'Our nation was truly delivered into the hands of the\rMarxist enemy by President Jimmy Carter and his administration. I was\rbetrayed by a longstanding and trusted ally.' Somoza had a point. Having\rlabeled the FSLN communists, and received encouragement and support\rfrom right-wing friends in the US military and in Congress for forty\ryears, Somoza could not believe that the United States would allow the\r'communists' to triumph.\n<br>\rBut Carter believed he had a mandate to restore US credibility after\rthe stains left by the Vietnam War and the revelations of CIA\rshenanigans - including its support for corrupt and brutal dictators.\rThe era of world politics had passed when American presidents could\rwith impunity maintain the Somozas of the Third World as reliable\rclients.\n\n\r\r\n</p><p class=\"entry columns3\">\nSince Somoza had no desire to transform himself and his Praetorian\rGuard into anything that could conceivably qualify as democracy, he\rchose more repression. He thought that by increasing the level of\rbrutality the Guard could cow the populace back into obedience. He\rwas wrong. The more brutal the Guard's behavior, the more resistant\rthe populace grew. As Guard units marched through the barrios, or\nrandomly shot poor teenagers and middle-class youth, fear turned to\routrage. People who for decades had accepted the savageries of the\rGuard could tolerate no more.\n<br>\nInside Nicaragua and in the United States, the anti-Somoza forces\rcoalesced. Illiterate peasants and local merchants in Nicaragua found\rthemselves allied in the struggle against Somoza with exiled dish\rwashers in Houston and University of California students. Some became\rguerrillas, while others served as lobbyists, pamphleteers, or fund raisers\rin Washington. A group of well known professionals and business\rexecutives formed 'Los Doce', a group of twelve reasonable and\rresponsible moderates who appealed to middle-class opinion throughout\rthe world to join in with money and moral support to oust the dictator\rand his hated Guard.\n<br>\rIn January 1978, an event occurred that galvanized the fragmented\ranti-Somoza opposition. Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the dynamic editor\rof <i>La Prensa</i>, Managua's leading daily, was assassinated. The popular\rChamorro had openly published demands for Somoza's removal, and\rcalled for broad national unity. Although lacking direct proof, most\rNicaraguans assumed Tachito had ordered the slaying. Chamorro, hardly\ra leftist, had criticized the FSLN 's radical rhetoric, but the Sandinistas,\rnevertheless, joined other anti-Somoza elements, including labor unions,\rin organizing mass protests, strikes and demonstrations in response to\rChamorro's murder. By mid-1978 the Church had added its weight to\rthe growing demand that Somoza resign.\n<br>\rThe US government was in the throes of a decisive policy debate.\rPresident Carter faced a choice: Somoza, a flagrant rights violator; or\rthe FSLN, regarded in intelligence and diplomatic circles as communists,\ror, at best, independent leftists friendly to Castro.\n<br>\r'Another Cuba' in Central America was deemed unacceptable, but\rthe continuation of Somoza rule appeared dubious. National Security\rAdviser, Zbigniew Brzinski, feared that by applying human rights criteria\rto Nicaragua, the United States would strengthen the revolutionaries.\rSince the Guard was loyal to Somoza, not the Nicaraguan Constitution,\rTachito's removal would lead to its disintegration, Brzinksi believed.\rThe only armed force then remaining would be the FSLN. The human\rrights activists inside the administration downplayed the Sandinista\rthreat and emphasized to the president the importance of maintaining\rconsistency on human rights. Carter compromised between the competing ideological wings of his administration.\n<br>\r\n</p><p class=\"entry columns3\" style=\"height:650px\">\nReversing nearly a century of tradition, President Carter asked Somoza\nto step down as a way of ending the civil war, while retaining intact the\rNational Guard, whose loyalties should logically rum from Somoza to\rits next benefactor, the United States. It was not an act of idealism, but\rrather a realistic judgment on the part of the president. US intelligence\rreports agreed that the tide had turned in Nicaragua and that the\rdictator's days were numbered. But Carter's decision came too late for\rthe national security apparatus to save the Guard. The action on the\rbattlefields had ensured the Sandinistas their rightful place as heads of\rState.<br>\rThe battlefield included the very center of government in Managua.\rOn 23 August 1978, eleven months before Somoza fled and the Guard\rcollapsed, Sandinista soldiers dressed in Guard uniforms arrived in army\rtrucks at both entrances of the National Palace, where Somoza's\rlegislature convened. Using their best imitation of Guard officer speech,\rthey deceived the troops stationed at the doors and other posts. Once\rinside, the Sandinistas held captive Somoza's friends, allies and even\rfamily members. For Tachito it was supremely humiliating.\n<br>\rA demoralized Somoza yielded to the Sandinistas' demands for the\rrelease of the Nicaraguan glitterati: $500,000 in exchange for safe\rconduct from the palace to the airport, where the captors would be\rflown to Cuba, plus the release of fifty-nine political prisoners. Even\rNational Guard officers winced when Somoza caved in. Morale sank\rfor a short time.\n<br>\rTo revive the fighting spirit of his men, Somoza ordered unprecedentedly\rvicious levels of reprisals against the revolutionaries. Inspired\rby their palace victory, the Sandinistas called for uprisings. In Matagalpa.\raccording to the Nicaraguan press, 'armed youths in rebellion' took\rover thirty city blocks. The Guard responded with artillery, armored\rvehicles and heavy machine-gun fire to retake the neighborhood. On\rAugust 27, the Catholic Church called upon Somoza to resign as 'the\ronly way to end the current political violence'.\n<br>\rIn the final days of August the depressed Tachito regained the\rruthlessness that had made him the scourge of the nation. He purged\rGuard officers who had criticized his weakness in bargaining with the\rrebels. Charged and found guilty of conspiring to overthrow the\rgovernment were eighty-five Guardsmen, including twelve officers. As\rfor the 'communists and subversives', his name for all revolutionaries,\rSomoza told his generals to show no mercy. Sandinisus or suspected\rsympathizers were rounded up, tortured, interrogated and then killed.\rThe Guard carried out fishing expeditions in the barrios, targeting\nespecially the youth. Thousands of men and women were arrested and\rshot simply because they were young. Instead of submitting, the public\rwere spurred to uncontainable rage.\n<br>\r</p><p class=\"entry\" style=\"height:650px\">\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the human rights advocates and the national security hawks\rdebated policy in Washington, the Guard's ferocity claimed the attention\rof the world's media. And the Sandinistas, feeling the public pulse,\rstruck. On 7 September 1978 guerrilla units descended from the\rmountains to launch a major offensive, attacking and holding parts of\rfive major cities. Several thousand Sandinistas took part in the offensive,\rsending the Guard reeling. Los muchachos (teenagers and children) spearheaded\rthe barrio insurrections.\n\n</p><p class=\"entry columns\" style=\"height:650px\">\n\n<img src=\"../mapimages/nicarguaresistance.jpg\" style=\"padding:7px;max-width:100%\">\n<span class=\"caption\">Susan Meiselas's  &quot;untitled&quot; 1979<br>\n</span>\nIn Leon, Grenada, Diriamba, Chinandega, Matagalpa and Managua,\rthe muchachos joined the uniformed guerrillas. They fought with weapons\rstolen from the Guard, sticks, stones and home-crafted Molotov cocktails. Faced with the wrath of the people, the Guard did not flee, but counterattacked with artillery and aeria1 bombing. When the smoke\rfinally cleared and the Guard regained control, the bodies of young\rboys and girls were strewn across the makeshift barricades and trenches.\rCommercial and residential areas, schools and churches, looked like\rCoventry after days of Axis bombing during World War II. Those\redifices that remained structurally in tact bore the scars of bullets and\rshells.\n<br>\nThe neighborhood of Monimbo, in the city of Masaya, rose up and\rwith home-made weapons and rocks held off the heavily armed troops,\rthen suffered the retaliation. 'We fought against the Guard to save our\rlives,' recalled Ernesto Rodriguez Zelaya, a Monimbo mechanic. 'We\rrealized that after the [Guard's} &quot;mopping up&quot; operation life wasn't\rworth anything. Whoever stayed home would be killed! It was easier\rfor us to grab a rifle and fight with the muchachos than stay home where\rwe would be just a target for the Guard. So it was the repression that\rmade us fight, because we didn't want to die.'\n<br>\rIn February 1978, Monimbo residents rose again, fought with unbelievable\rcourage, using paving stones from Somoza's own factory as\rweapons, and then faced the renewed vengeance of the Guard.\rBut even after the continued bombing and shelling of the area, the\rMonimbo dwellers refused to submit. The Guard could not regain\rcontrol.\n<br>\rThe behavior of the Monimbo populace dramatized a larger reality,\rone that even jaded members of US intelligence could not escape: the\rvast majority of Nicaraguans were prepared to endure immense pain\nand suffering to rid themselves of the Somoza family and their Guard.\r<br>\rTachito understood the people's loathing and responded accordingly.\rHe ordered his air force to bomb and strafe guerrilla-held cities. Even\rafter the FSLN had retreated, the air force continued to bomb, to\rensure that the populace would get the message. When the bodies were\rcounted, the Red Cross announced that over five thousand had perished\rfrom Esteli, Masaya and Leon alone. A further 10,000 were missing;\r15,000 were wounded; 30,000 were homeless. Refugees poured into\rimprovised camps just across the frontiers.\n\n</p><p class=\"entry columns3\" style=\"height:650px\">\n\n\nBy May 1979 Somoza and his generals decided that the situation\rlooked bleak, and that if they were to reassume control of Nicaragua,\rMasaya was the strategic place to begin. On June 9 the National Guard\rbegan intensive bombing and strafing of Monimbo, 'the pissed off\rbarrio', as it became known. Following the bombing, a column of\rSherman tanks led Guard foot soldiers through the Sandinista controlled\rneighborhoods to retake portions of Masaya.\r<br>\rThe guerrillas beat a strategic retreat, but returned unexpectedly three\rdays later and retook most of the city. For two weeks the battle raged,\rblock by block. 'The Guard didn't push us out: a Sandinista officer\rreported, 'because they didn't receive reinforcements, nor did we take\rthem out since we didn't have any ammunition.'\n<br>\rOn June 24 Guard officers and men abandoned their Masaya\rcommand post, using hundreds of political prisoners as a shield to cover\rtheir retreat. The Sandinistas were in undisputed control of the city,\rtwenty miles south of Managua. Somoza spent his days in the bunker,\rbuilt on top of a Managua hill overlooking the Intercontinental Hotel.\rOne June evening he met members of the media in an 'off the record'\rsession. One reporter, nevertheless, recorded the conversation. Why\rwas he bombing his own people, destroying Nicaraguan property, he\rwas asked. 'What do you know about underdevelopment?' he slurred,\rshowing the effects of a day of drinking. 'My people are a bunch of\rlazy, stupid, underdeveloped assholes.'\n<br>\rIn late June, Tachito ordered his bombers to drop 500 pounders on\rdensely populated Managua neighborhoods. The Sandinistas, who had\rtaken the poor barrios from the Guard, immediately retreated to Masaya,\rbut the muchachos who survived the bombings continued to snipe at and\rambush the Guard in the capital. The US ambassador demanded that\rSomoza resign, hoping that it was still not too late to save the Guard\rexcept for its most notorious officers. Apart from unwavering support\rfrom the Israeli government - of which Somoza had been a loyal supporter - and a few cohorts among the remaining Latin American\rdictators, Tachito was isolated.</p><p class=\"entry columns3\" style=\"height:650px\">\nHe knew the war was over, but nevertheless ordered his air force to\rcontinue bombing. His family had stolen hundreds of millions of dollars\rfrom the Nicaraguan people, and Tachito expressed his attitude toward\rhis victims as if to make a final statement that would etch into\rNicaraguan memory the essence of the cruelty that had characterized\rthe forty-five years of Somoza clan rule.\n<br>\rOn July 17 the Somoza family fled to Miami, Florida. Without\rSomoza's presence, there was nothing to hold the Guard together.\rOverwhelmed and demoralized, the once invincible National Guard\rcollapsed. Some units surrendered to FSLN commanders, others fled\ras one or in ragtag fashion to borders north and south. On July 19 the\rSandinistas held state power.\n<br>\rThe Nicaragua Revolution triumphed, like the Cuban one twenty\ryears earlier, not just because of the Sandinistas' astute military strategy\rand tactics employed, or the mistakes of the National Guard. A peculiar\rconjuncture of events and times also created a setting on which the\rdecisive battles were fought. In Washington, the human rights element\rin the administration temporarily obstructed national security interventionists;\rCosta Rica provided unusual levels of help for the Sandinistas,\rthanks to Somoza's 'bad neighbor' policy toward the San Jose\rregime; in Cuba, a Solomon-like Fidel Castro persuaded the rival factions\rof the FSLN to bury their ideological differences and unify.\n<br>\rThe revolution could not have triumphed without the ambivalence\rof President Carter, just as its subsequent programs could not be realized\rwithout a similar kind of vacillation from the Reagan administration.\rThe Sandinistas captured world opinion, an intangible factor that\rnevertheless wove its way through White House thinking and mass\rmedia concepts and images. Somoza had made fundamental errors in\rjudgment. His tactics had alienated even the wealthy, who had for\rdecades accepted the caprices of his family rule.\rThe Somozas had accumulated more than 5500 million during their\rdynastic rule. They possessed one fifth of Nicaragua's arable land and\rmore than one hundred and fifty businesses. In addition, the family had\raccounts and assets in the United States and Europe that were believed\rto be more than double what they owned in Nicaragua. Somoza believed\rthat as long as the United States was interested in maintaining its\rhegemony, the US government would protect him. Tachito's contempt\rfor his own countrymen and women was so great that it did not occur to him that Nicaraguans could play a role in determining the fate of\rtheir nation.</p>","source":"THE GUERRILLA WARS \r\nOF CENTRAL AMERICA, Saul Landau "},{"id":"powarg1978","title":"The Papal Nuncio","type":"power","loc":"arg12","start":1978,"end":1978,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">Admiral Massera retires.

In 1986, Reagan dismantled the allowance of imported small gifts an remittances to Cuban relatives. In 1988, Reagan put up restrictions on subsidiaries making shipments to and from Cuba, which had been mainly through third party countries.\n<br>\nThroughout Reagan's term, the US Treasury was ordered to crack down on previously overlooked aspects of the embargo, including examining what special visa holders were doing in Cuba. Of particular interest were journalists, scholars, and lawyers. Numerous cases and lawsuits were filed to send the message that Cuban relations and trading were going to be strictly monitored.\n<br>\nThe Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 further restricted trade: Third party nations and foreign US-owned or operated subsidiaries were again forbidden from trading with Cuba, boats belonging to third party nations were disallowed from docking in the United States for 180 days after trading with Cuba, and the treasury department got the right to prosecute any violators, with fines of $1M for corporations, and $100K for civilians. It also  reinstated the denial of American aid to countries that provided assistance to Cuba.\n<br>\nThe CDA was met with a resounding disdain in the international community, leading to a UN resolution directed at the United States expressing a deep concern for the US extraterritorial legislation.

Despite its overwhelming unpopularity, the CDA was not be revoked.\n<br> \nFollowing the election of Bill Clinton, small reforms were passed, but nothing that really affected the overall policy.

The act included the following:\n\n<br>• International Sanctions against the Castro Government. Economic embargo, any non-US company dealing economically with Cuba can be subjected to legal action and that company's leadership can be barred from entry into the United States. Sanctions may be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. This means that internationally operating companies have to choose between Cuba and the US, which is a much larger market.\n<br>• United States opposition against Cuban membership in international financial institutions.\n<br>• Television broadcasting from the United States to Cuba.\n<br>• Authorization of United States support for democratic and human rights groups and international observers.\n<br>• U.S. policy towards a transition government and a democratically elected government in Cuba.

One of those groups, formed after the first Reagan inauguration, was the U.S. Council for World Freedom (USCWF), headed by Major General John Singlaub. \n<br>\nThe USCWF quickly became the U.S. branch of the World Anti-Communist League (WACL). The USCWF began building support for the Reagan policy of aiding not only the Nicaraguan Contras but RENAMO and UNITA in southern Africa and rightist Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan. Singlaub informed Central Intelligence Agency director William Casey and National Security Council staff of his actions and operated with their assent, if not under their direction.\n<br>\n<img src=\"../mapimages/waclconvention1981.jpg\" style=\"padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;\"><br>\n<span class=\"caption\"> A World Anti-Communist League Convention</span>\n<br>\nOne of the early USCWF financial backers was Joe Coors (Yes, of Coors Beer), according to two former USCWF treasurers.

The Contras were originally known as the 15th of September Legion. Their earliest training came from Argentinian military intelligence, which ran death squads in that country and sponsored a Latin American conference of death squad leaders in 1980.

Contra project officers in Washington created a covert financial support apparatus run by Oliver North and his superiors. A public financial support apparatus coordinated by Singlaub was also tied into the White House, Joe Coors worked with both fundraising networks. Joe Coors was one of the boosters of a big fundraising dinner for the Contras in 1985 arranged by the Nicaraguan Refugee Fund at which Reagan was the keynote speaker. The Fund was set up by the Contras' fundraising arm and promoted by a public relations firm whose founder had long-standing Central Intelligence Agency links.\n<br>\nCoors also contributed to the Nicaraguan Freedom Foundation (NFF), established by the Moon-owned Washington Times. Board members of NFF included Jeane Kirkpatrick, William Simon, and Michael Novak. Simon and Novak were on the board of PRODEMCA, which also funneled money to the Contras. Jeane Kirkpatrick and her husband Byron Kirkpatrick publish a quarterly magazine, World Affairs, which has published an article endorsing the use of death squads. The Christian Broadcast Network (CBN), whose Regent University is supported by the Coors Foundation and has Holly Coors on its board, was one of the largest donors to the Contra cause, giving millions of dollars to the Contras in Central America (the Nicaraguan Freedom Foundation funds went there as well). Christian Broadcast Network owner Pat Robertson held a telethon on May 30, 1985 to raise funds for the Contras.\n<img src=\"../mapimages/contracamp1984-1.jpg\" style=\"padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;\"><br>\n<span class=\"caption\"> Contra Camp, 1984</span><br>\n\n</p><p class=\"entry columns\">\n<img src=\"../mapimages/contracamp1984-2.jpg\" style=\"padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;\"><br>\n<span class=\"caption\"> Contra Camp, 1984</span><br>\nAnother active Contra support group was Citizens for America, cochaired by Lewis Lehrman and Holly Coors. Citizens for America was formed in coordination with the White House in 1983 to build support for Reagan's programs. In 1985, it organized a tour of twenty Contras to two hundred congressional districts to lobby for Contra funding. Lehrman also organized a June 2, 1985 meeting in Angola that brought together the Nicaraguan Contras, the South African-backed UNITA leaders, and similar rightist groups from around the world.\n<br>\nOther Coors-funded groups that have actively supported the Contras include the Heritage Foundation, the Free Congress Foundation, and The Conservative Caucus (TCC). TCC has said for example, &quot;The Conservative Caucus has advocated a strategy of victory over Communism in Nicaragua from the very beginning—and we will continue to press for aid to the Contras, de-recognition of the Sandinistas, and a new government, friendly to the United States.&quot;\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"../mapimages/olivernorthtcchowardphillips1981.jpg\" style=\"height:40%;padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;\"><br>\n<font class=\"caption\">Oliver North with The Conservative Caucus's Howard Phillips, this photo was used in fundraising appeals.</font><br><br>\nJoe Coors also became involved with Oliver North in the clandestine Contra support networks. On May 21, 1987, he told Congress that he met with Central Intelligence Agency director William Casey, on June 18, 1985, to offer support for the Contras. (Coors knew Casey from the 1980 presidential campaign and had been funding the National Strategy Information Center with which Casey had worked.) Casey directed Coors to Oliver North, who got Coors to buy a small airplane for the Contras. Coors then transferred $65,000 from his account to the Lake Resources account in Switzerland controlled by North.</p><p class=\"entry columns\" style=\"height:650px\">\n<img src=\"../mapimages/contracamp1984-3.jpg\" style=\"padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;\"><br>\n<span class=\"caption\"> Contra Camp, 1984</span><br>\n\nThe Heritage Foundation was also involved in the secret Contra funding schemes. Heritage in 1985 &quot;donated&quot; $100,000 to the Institute for North. South Issues (INSI), an Oliver North-connected conduit. From INSI, $80,000 of the money went to the account of LC., Inc., a North-Spitz Channell conduit to the Contras. The $100,000 came from a private con-tributor contacted by Roy Godson, a National Security Council consultant and director of the National Strategy Information Center. A Congressional report noted, &quot;The true objective of this 'grant' was disguised in correspondence between (Richard) Miller (as Treasurer of INSI) and Edwin J. Feulner (as president of Heritage Foundation) with whom Godson had met previously.&quot;<br>\nThe &quot;private&quot; aid that Coors and others provided to the Contras appeared to violate U.S. neutrality laws which state: <br><i>\nWhoever, within the United States, knowingly begins or sets on foot [sic) or provides or prepares a means for or furnishes the money for, or takes part in, any military or naval expedition or enterprise to be carried on from thence against the territory or dominion of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district, or people with whom the United States is at peace, shall be fined not more than $3,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\n</i><br>\n In fact, several other private individuals supplying aid to the Contras have been prosecuted. Spitz Channell and members of Civilian Military Assistance, for example, have been indicted for the violation of federal laws. In 1985, Jack Terrel, a leader of a civilian commando unit that aided the Contras and himself indicted in the Iran-Contra scandal, revealed that &quot;Coors brewery is one of the Contras' biggest supporters.&quot;\n<br>\n<img src=\"../mapimages/joecoorsandednoble.gif\" style=\"padding:7px;column-span: all;max-width:100%;\"><br>\n<span class=\"caption\"> Ed Noble and Joseph Coors, founders of the Heritage Foundation</span>\n\n</p>","source":"The Coors Connection: How Coors Family Philanthropy Undermines Democratic Pluralism by Russ Bellant"},{"id":"econarg1981","title":"Rapid Turnover","type":"economy","loc":"arg12","start":1981,"end":1981,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">A year of economic crisis and a rapid turnover of military presidents.

Sharp increases in military assistance to Honduras followed the buildup of United States troops and equipment in Honduras. In 1983 United States forces began a series of large- scale maneuvers in Honduras that not only provided joint training for United States and Honduran forces but also allowed the administration of Ronald W. Reagan to skirt congressional limits on military aid to that country and the Contras. Throughout the 1980s, the United States also built or improved military-related installations such as airfield, barracks, and radar stations. \n<br>\nIn February 1983, the United States and Honduras conducted a joint military exercise called Big Pine, which was the largest of its kind ever held in Honduras. A total of 1,600 United States military personnel and 4,000 Honduran soldiers participated in exercises designed to help Honduras improve its deployment techniques and logistical support in the field. United States Army elements provided mobility for Honduran forces and logistics and communications assistance. United States Navy elements included two landing ships and two landing craft. United States Air Force personnel participated in the coordination of landing and air supply operations. A number of training personnel, mostly from the United States Army, remained in the country to train the Honduran army in infantry tactics. Also during the exercises, a sizable radar installation staffed by over fifty United States Air Force technicians was placed south of Tegucigalpa. \n<br>\nThe number of United States advisers increased further in mid- 1983 when the United States and Honduras approved a new training agreement as an amendment to the 1954 military assistance agreement. The two countries constructed a military training facility, near Puerto Castilla on the Caribbean coast, at a cost of some US$250,000. The primary purpose of this facility, called the Regional Center for Military Training (Centro Regional de Entrenamiento Militar—CREM), was to train Salvadoran ground forces, although Hondurans also received training. The center initially had about 125 United States Army Special Forces personnel, raising the total number of trainers in the country to approximately 270 in July 1983. \n<br>\nAlthough CREM closed in 1985, United States military advisers remained. Between 1983 and 1993, the United States and Honduras have carried out an almost continuous string of joint military maneuvers on Honduran soil. To facilitate the maneuvers and strengthen Honduras's military infrastructure, the Honduran government has built a network of roads, improved ports, and constructed additional airfields. \n<br>\nBetween August 1983 and February 1984, United States forces carried out Big Pine II, a considerably more extensive military exercise than the earlier Big Pine maneuvers, involving up to 5,000 United States military personnel. Extensive naval maneuvers involved two United States Navy aircraft carrier task forces, another task force led by the battleship U.S.S. New Jersey, and a landing by the United States Marines on the Caribbean coast during portions of the exercises. The purpose, according to a senior United States official, was to demonstrate the ability of United States military forces to operate in Central America and to persuade the Sandinista government of Nicaragua to desist from fomenting insurrection in the region. </p>","source":"\nFederal Research Division of the Library of Congress under the Country Studies<br>\nArea Handbook Program sponsored by the Department of the Army"},{"id":"pownic1983b","title":"Contra Terrorism","type":"power","loc":"nic1","start":1983,"end":1983,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">January\nterrorist attacks before initiation of Big Pine Maneuvers, 120 Ex Guardsmen</p>","source":""},{"id":"pownic1983","title":"&quot;To Reagan, Nicaragua had to be re-conquered&quot;","type":"power","loc":"nic1","start":1983,"end":1983,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">In 1983, the Nicaraguan government accused the CIA twice of hatching a plot to kill Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto, of which the CIA aborted both attempts.

To Reagan Nicaragua had to be re-conquered. He blamed Carter for having lost Nicaragua, as if Nicaragua ever belonged to anyone else other than the Nicaraguan people.

The clampdown on the protesters and looters was harsh after Tuesday the 28th, as the military was called out on the streets in several major cities and a curfew was set—measures that had not been used in Venezuela in several generations. \n\nWith the police and National Guard unable to restore order, Perez called out the army on the night of Monday, Feb. 27, and the troops brutally cracked down on the rioters, who were acting without clear objectives or political leadership of any kind. \n\nIt is true as well, as journalists witnessed at the time, that the army also attempted on a number of occasions to at least impose order among the chaos, having looters stand in organised lines that filed in and out of supermarkets and stores, and ensuring that they only took food and did not cause damages. \n\n&quot;It was the first breakdown of the institutional pact under which democracy had functioned since 1958, a kind of collective decision to break with the prevailing state of law. But it was also a great national failure, a fight without winners, which remains a huge open wound,&quot; said sociologist Tulio Hernandez. \n\n The end result: hundreds of people killed, around 2,000 injured and more than 150 million dollars in damages to shops and businesses. \nOn the 28th, Andres Perez suspended a number of constitutional civil liberties as the country had been effectively shut down within two days. The protests continued, and the military were sent in.

The perpetrators were Salvadoran criminals operating under the direction of Luis Posada Carriles and financed in Miami. One of the most notorious international terrorists, Posada had escaped from a Venezuelan prison, where he had been held for the Cubana airliner bombing, with the aid of Jorge Mas Canosa, a Miami businessman who was the head of the tax-exempt Cuban-American National Foundation (CANF). Posada went from Venezuela to El Salvador, where he was put to work at the Ilopango military air base to help organize US terrorist attacks against Nicaragua under Oliver North's direction.\n\nPosada has described in detail his terrorist activities and the funding for them from exiles and CANF in Miami, but felt secure that he would not be investigated by the FBI. He was a Bay of Pigs veteran, and his subsequent operations in the 1960s were directed by the CIA. When he later joined Venezuelan intelligence with CIA help, he was able to arrange for Orlando Bosch, an associate from his CIA days who had been convicted in the US for a bomb attack on a Cuba-bound freighter, to join him in Venezuela to organize further attacks against Cuba. An ex-CIA official familiar with the Cubana bombing identifies Posada and Bosch as the only suspects in the bombing, which Bosch defended as &quot;a legitimate act of war.&quot; Generally considered the &quot;mastermind&quot; of the airline bombing, Bosch was responsible for thirty other acts of terrorism, according to the FBI. He was granted a presidential pardon in 1989 by the incoming Bush I administration after intense lobbying by Jeb Bush and South Florida Cuban-American leaders, overruling the Justice Department, which had found the conclusion &quot;inescapable that it would be prejudicial to the public interest for the United States to provide a safe haven for Bosch [because] the security of this nation is affected by its ability to urge credibly other nations to refuse aid and shelter to terrorists.&quot;</p>","source":"Hegemony or Survival Chomsky"},{"id":"redstarmex1997","title":"The Conflict Zone","type":"redstar","loc":"mex2","start":1997,"end":1997,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">JULY<br>\nThe July 6 midterm elections mark significant gains for opposition parties:\ninside the &quot;conflict zone&quot; in Chiapas, howevever, abstention reaches 80 percent.\nChiapas' elections are notoriously fraudulent, and the high rate of abstention\nreflects a general mistrust of government in indigenous communities.</p>","source":"Zapatista Timeline by Tom Hansen and Enlace Civil"},{"id":"indmex1997","title":"FZLN","type":"ind","loc":"mex1","start":1997,"end":1997,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">\n<span class=\"medhed\">SEPTEMBER</span><br>\nOn September 12, Zapatistas arrive in Mexico City for the founding\nof the unarmed Zapatista National Liberation Front (FZLN), the civil political\narm of the indigenous movement.</p>","source":"Zapatista Timeline by Tom Hansen and Enlace Civil"},{"id":"massacremex1997","title":"45 Killed","type":"massacre","loc":"mex23","start":1997,"end":1997,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9XjlT7ja20M?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>\nDECEMBER<br>\nOn December 22, a paramilitary group affiliated with the PRI\nattacks a church in the community of Acteal, killing 45 Indigenous\ncampesinos, mostly women and children.

Colombia receives more US military aid than the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean combined. The total for 1999 reached about $300 million, along with $60 million in arms sales, approximately a threefold increase from 1998. The figure is scheduled to increase still more sharply with the anticipated passage of some version of Clinton's Colombia Plan, submitted to Congress in April 2000, which called for a $1.6 billion &quot;emergency aid&quot; package for two years. Through the 1990s, Colombia has been by far the leading recipient of US military aid in Latin America, and has also compiled by far the worst human rights record, in conformity with a well-established and long-standing correlation.<br>\nIn theory, &quot;Plan Colombia&quot; is a two-year Colombian government program of $7.5 billion, with the US providing the military muscle and token funds for other purposes, and some $6 billion from the Colombian government, Europe, the IMF, and the World Bank for social and economic programs that Colombia is to prepare. According to non-US diplomats, the draft of &quot;Plan Colombia&quot; was written in English, not Spanish. The military program (arms, training, intelligence infrastructure) was in place in late 1999, but &quot;the Colombian govern-ment has yet to present a coherent social investment program&quot; as of mid-2000, and few governments are &quot;willing to climb aboard what is widely perceived as an American project to clean up its backyard,&quot; by means that are familiar to those who do not choose what has been called &quot;intentional ignorance.&quot;\n<br>\nThe Colombian Commission of Jurists reported in September 1999 that the rate of killings had increased by almost 20 percent over the preceding year, and that the proportion attributable to the paramilitaties had risen from 46 percent in 1995 to almost 80 percent in 1998, continuing through 1999. The Colombian government's Human Rights Ombudsman's Office (Defensoria del Pueblo) reported a 68 percent increase in massacres in the first half of 1999 as compared to the same period of 1998, reaching more than one a day, overwhelmingly attributed to paramilitaries. Daniel Bland, a human rights researcher who worked in Colombia through most of the 1990s, concludes that in the past three years alone, &quot;more than a million people have been forced from their homes in the countryside, and between 5,000 and 7,000 unarmed peasants have been slaughtered by right-wing paramilitaries.&quot; Of nine people he interviewed for a documentary on human rights in 1997—professors, journalists, priests, human rights workers—&quot;three have since been murdered by paramilitary gunmen; four have fled with their families after receiving death threats.&quot; UNICEF and the Colombian Human Rights Information Bureau CODRES estimate that in June-August 1999 alone, 200,000 more people were driven from their homes.</p>","source":"Rogue States, Chomsky"},{"id":"powcub1999","title":"One of Clinton's Many Global Initiatives","type":"power","loc":"cub1","start":1999,"end":1999,"entry":"<p class=\"entry \">The Bush I administration reacted to the elimination of the security pretext by making the embargo much harsher, under pressure from Clinton, who outflanked Bush from the right during the 1992 election campaign.

He was arrested in 1970, after being accused of belonging to armed anti-colonial insurgency groups, but he evaded prosecution by again returning underground. Later, in 1978, he helped found the Ejercito Popular Boricua-Macheteros, also known as Los Macheteros. Notorious for its brazen attacks on U.S. military interests, the guerrillas proclaimed their goal of securing the independence of Puerto Rico through revolutionary action.\nIn 1985, the FBI launched raids against independence activists across the island, angering even the local Commonwealth government, which had not been warned in advance. After a dramatic firefight, Ojeda Rios was among those arrested, but was later acquitted. While his acquittal was for charges stemming from his armed resistance to the FBI's arrest attempt—which he claimed was an assassination attempt—the real charges brought by the FBI immediately after the acquittal included seditious conspiracy and charges for the 1983 Wells Fargo bank heist, which the Macheteros publicly took credit for. Ojeda Rios knew that they had been pursuing him since the late 1960s and was clear on the need to protect his life and his organization.\nOjeda Rios returned underground in 1990, causing widespread embarrassment to the FBI. Over the next 15 years, his would be the voice of rebellion and revolution, of social justice, of the working class, and of his ultimate vision of a Puerto Rico emancipated from the dependency and control of U.S. colonialism. His name and figure became legendary; his voice and image repeatedly emerged in the form of videos, voice recordings, and even exclusive TV interviews.\nUnrelenting in its pursuit, the FBI sent Quantico's Hostage Rescue Team to attack Ojeda Rios's home in the mountains of Hormigueros in September 2005. Elma Beatriz Rosado, his wife, safely made it out of the home during the firefight that ensued. She witnessed the ambush in which Ojeda Rios was left to bleed to death after an FBI sniper's single bullet wounded him. News reports suggested that agents tampered with the scene, and officials at FBI headquarters discussed portraying the incident as a suicide in order to cover up misconduct.\n\n&quot;Puerto Rico has a history that is very heroic and prolific. Naturally, as a colony, there exists a history of double interpretation; the colony, and the history of the anti-colonial struggle. In reality, the colonial history does not apply to us.

SUNTRACS homes organize armed defense, while the government claims it was some kind of conspiracy and signs arrest warrants for SUNTRACS leaders, which it eventual retracts. </p>","source":""},{"id":"powcol2009","title":"Full Spectrum Operations","type":"power","loc":"col1","start":2009,"end":2009,"entry":"<p class=\"entry shen\">The U.S. announces the deployment of U.S. military forces at seven military bases in Colombia.

The soldiers grabbed President Zelaya from his bed, forced him onto an airplane and flew him into exile. The state television was taken off the air.

Herberth Inestroza justified the military coup and stated in an interview with the Miami Herald , &quot;It would be difficult for us, with our training, to have a relationship with a leftist government. That's impossible.'' The crisis in Honduras began when the military refused to distribute ballot\n boxes for a referendum to determine whether or not a majority of Hondurans want to enter a process to modify their constitution.  In response, President Zelaya fired the head of the military, SOA graduate General Romeo Vasquez Velasquez. The heads of all branches of the armed forces then quit in solidarity with Vasquez. Vasquez, however, refused to step down, bolstered by a Court ruling that reinstated him. Vasquez remains in control of the armed forces.\nVasquez Velasquez, along with Honduran Air Force, General Luis Prince Suazo and other coup leaders, graduated from the SOA. Records show that Vasquez Velasquez \ntook a basic combat arms course at SOA in 1976 and another course on small military units in 1984, while Prince Suazo took a 1996 course on joint operations.
