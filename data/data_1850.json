In November 1751, under the leadership of a Pima leader, Captain-General Luis Oacpicagigua, the Pima rose in revolt. Within a few days more than a hundred settlers, miners, and ranchers were killed. Churches were burned, and two priests were also killed. However, on January 4, 1752, approximately 2,000 northern Pimans attacked less than one hundred Spaniards, only to be repulsed with a loss of forty-three dead. The Pima Revolt lasted only four months, ending with the surrender of Luis Oacpicagigua, who offered himself in sacrifice and atonement for his whole people, endeavoring to spare them the consequences of their uprising.",

But Brazilian gold was channeled to London by licit as well as illicit methods. The gold boom, which brought a host of Portuguese to Minas Gerais, sharply stimulated colonial demand for industrial products and at the same time provided the means to pay for them. Just as Potosi silver rebounded off Spanish soil, Minas Gerais gold only reached Portugal in transit. The metropolis became an intermediary. In 1755 the Marquis de Pombal, Portugal's prime minister, tried to revive a protectionist policy, but it was too late. He declared that the English had conquered Portugal without the trouble of a conquest, that they were supplying two-thirds of its needs, and that British agents controlled the whole of Portuguese trade. Portugal was producing almost nothing, and the wealth brought by gold was so illusory that even the black slaves who mined it were clothed by the British.<br>\nCelso Furtado has noted that Britain, following a farsighted policy with respect to industrial development, used Brazilian gold to pay for essential imports from other countries and could thus concentrate on investments in the manufacturing sector. Thanks to this historical graciousness on the part of the Portuguese, Britain could apply rapid and efficient technical innovations. Europe's financial center moved from Amsterdam to London. According to British sources, the value of Brazilian gold arriving in London reached \u00a350,000 a week in some periods. Without this tremendous accumulation of gold reserves, Britain would not have been able, later on, to confront Napoleon.",

Reportedly, runaway slaves living in the quilombo Campo Grande had plotted a rebellion that never actually took place. \n<br>\nOne of the most important quilombos in colonial Brazil was Campo Grande, which consisted of some twenty-five different settlements. By the 1750s, its population had surpassed 20,000. This quilombo was also significant because it seems that in addition to runaway slaves, many of the original inhabitants were free blacks and mulatoes and poor whites. \n<br>\nIn 1756, the inhabitants of Campo Grande purportedly planned a rebellion, in which they would join with slaves against the European colonists in Minas Gerais. According to rumors at the time, the Africans were planning to attack on holy Thursday while the white Brazilians attended church services. Reportedly, they would kill all of the white and mulatto men, while sparing the women. The plot never came to fruition, perhaps because it was discovered before it began, although there is no real evidence that the plot was genuine. This incident is important, however, in that it demonstrates the extent to which white Brazilians feared runaway black communities. (Ronald Young)",

In 1581, the Dutch had colonized the region, setting up sugar plantations and bringing slave labor from Africa. As in many other European colonies outside of the 13 British colonies, the number of slaves in Guyana greatly outnumbered whites. At the time of the 1763 revolt, the population of blacks in the colony was about 10 times greater than that of whites.\nKnown as the Great Rebellion, the revolt in Guyana involved as many as half the slaves in the entire colony. Triggered by the cruel treatment of slaves, the rebellion began on one plantation where slaves killed their overseer and a carpenter and burned down the owner's house. The rebels then marched from plantation to plantation, and at each, unhappy slaves joined the cause. During the rebellion, many whites were killed, and many plantations and fields were burned.The uprising was led by a slave named Cuffy, a cooper(barrel maker) in the colony. Cuffy and his army of slaves eventually overthrew the Dutch government and took control. The rebels managed to stay in power for more than a year before being defeated by European forces. \nBy late March, the slave rebels controlled most of the colony, but they were not able to take the island's largest fort. Eventually, reinforcements arrived and aided by conflict within rebel ranks were able to reestablish control over the colony. About 60 percent of the whites died during the rebellion and almost 40 percent of the slaves. Of the rebels, 128 were executed in various cruel ways designed to dissuade the slaves fro, further revolts. As the rebellion fell apart, Cuffy took his own life to avoid being tortured and executed. Today, he is considered a national hero in Guyana.",

The rebellion broke out in Tinta province, which had been almost depopulated by enforced service in the Cerro Rico mines. Mounted on his white horse, Tupac Amaru entered the plaza of Tungasuca and announced to the sound of drums and pututus that he had condemned the royal Corregidor Antonio Juan de Arriaga to the gallows and put an end to the Potosi mita. A few days later Tupac issued a decree liberating the slaves. He abolished all taxes and forced labor in all forms. The Indians rallied by the thousands to the forces of the &quot;father of all the poor and all the wretched and helpless.&quot; He moved against Cuzco at the head of his guerilleros, promising them that all who died while under his orders in this war would return to life to enjoy the happiness and wealth the invaders had wrested from them. Victories and defeats followed; in the end, betrayed and captured by one of his own chiefs, Tupac was handed over in chains to the royalists. The Examiner Areche entered his cell to demand, in exchange for promises, the names of his rebel accomplices. Tupac Amaru replied scornfully, &quot;There are no accomplices here but you and I.

His head was sent to Tinta, one arm to Tungasuca and the other to Carabaya, one leg to Santa Rosa and the other to Livitaca. The torso was burned and the ashes thrown in the Rio Watanay. It was proposed that all his descendants be obliterated up to the fourth generation.\n<br>\nNearly two centuries had to pass after Tupac Amaru's death before the nationalist general Juan Velasco Alvarado would take up and apply Tupac's resounding, never forgotten words: &quot;Campesino!

The Venezuelan rebel, personally opposed to slavery, offered freedom in return for 10 years military service.\n<br>\nFrancisco de Miranda, who had read the works of the\r<i>philosophes</i> during his army service in Spain in the 1770s, transformed\rideology into activism. It was in New York, in 1784, that Francisco de Miranda conceived\rthe idea of 'the liberty and independence of the whole Spanish American\rcontinent'. The model of revolution offered by France had less appeal. As\rMiranda observed in 1799, &quot;We have before our eyes two great examples,\rthe American and the French Revolutions. Let us prudently imitate the\rfirst and carefully shun the second.&quot; <br>\nSpanish American revolutionaries anxiously disassociated themselves\rfrom the Haitian revolution. Miranda in particular was concerned about\rits effect on his reputation in England: &quot;I confess that much as I desire the\rliberty and independence of the New World, I fear anarchy and revolution\reven more. God forbid that the other countries suffer the same fate\ras Saint-Domingue, scene of carnage and crimes, committed on the\rpretext of establishing liberty; better that they should remain another\rcentury under the barbarous and senseless oppression of Spain.&quot;\n<br>\nMiranda argued that it was vital for him to reach Venezuela first, before\rthe Haitians did, and in 1806 he led a tiny expedition to his homeland.\rUnfortunately for his reputation he stopped to re-group in Haiti, where\rhe was advised not to be content with exhorting the Creoles to rise but &quot;to\rcut off heads and burn property&quot;, and where a rumour started that he\rplanned to use black Haitians.34 In fact, Miranda was as socially conservative\ras other Creoles and he had no intention of inciting a race war. But\rthe damage was done. At Coro he was met first by a stony silence then by\ropposition from Creole landowners, who denounced him as a &quot;heretic&quot;\rand a &quot;traitor&quot;.\n<br>\nAt that time both mantuanos and the population at large rallied to the side of the Spanish\rauthorities against Miranda, whose call for outright independence still\rappeared too radical. The fear of inadvertently setting off a Haitian-style\ruprising among slaves and free pardos, who together amounted to over\rhalf the population of Venezuela, was a particular reason for caution\ramong upper-class Creoles. At the same time, fear of the masses was an\rimportant reason for not leaving the maintenance of order to the\rappointed servants of a weakening and seemingly unreliable Spanish\rgovernment, which had already on various occasions shown itself too\rwilling to encourage the aspirations of the <i>pardos</i>.\n<br>\n Simon Bol\u00edvar, who followed Miranda as a leading figure in Venezuelan revolutionary circles (and who was a member of the group that arrested Miranda and turned him over to the Spanish), actively recruited slaves beginning in 1816, and would not have succeeded without drawing them away from the royalist cause.",

With the seat of the Portuguese government in Rio de Janeiro, many of the old restrictions on trade and commerce disappeared. Most important, the government opened Brazil's ports to British trade and merchants, manufacturing was encouraged, schools and institutions of higher education were constructed, and a new army was formed. (Everything changed again when Napoleon was defeated in 1815. Many Brazilian men and women were initially optimistic when Portugal granted Brazil coequal status as a kingdom in 1816, but Portuguese in Portugal gradually reconstructed their country and demanded that mercantilism be restored and that King Jo\u00e3o return to Portugal in 1821. Both Jo\u00e3o and his son, Pedro, recognized that too much had changed to return to the days when Brazil was a colony. Thus, as he left for Portugal, Jo\u00e3o advised his son to be ready to seize the crown of Brazil if demands for independence accelerated. Under pressure from the Portuguese C\u00f4rtes and Portuguese troops in Brazil, Pedro issued his &quot;fico&quot; or declaration that &quot;I am staying&quot; on January 9, 1822. He created a new government with some Brazilian advisors then announced &quot;Independence or Death&quot; on September 7, 1822.

        "entry": "\n\nThe Nineteenth-Century Context of Immigration and Colonization\rFor half a century after the abolition of the Directorate in 1798, neither\rPortugal nor Brazil had an effective settlement policy for the Amazon\rBasin. Shortly before Brazil's political independence in 1822, the Belem\relite began a heady orgy of political temper tantrums, pitting Portuguese\ragainst Creole in petty politicking that eventually broke into the open\rwarfare known as the Cabanagem revolt. The political rhetoric and vitriol\rdid not reflect fundamental social or economic differences between\rthe participants but simply questions of political method and the spoils of\roffice. However, by engaging numbers of the semifree peasants and\rdetribalized Indians of the region (known as caboclos), workers, and marginal\rsmall farmers to do the physical fighting, the elite foretold their own\rdestruction. In 1835, when the lower class eventually rose in rebellion\ragainst the men they perceived as authority figures, a good many individuals\rof the ruling class died violent deaths.\n<br>\rMost of the fighting and destruction during the Cabanagem took place\rin and around Selem, but outbreaks of violence occurred all over the basin.\rIt was a localized rebellion over local issues, with limited ideological\rscope that spread over an immense territory. It was not a revolt with a\rclear agenda or purpose, but the violence was often a matter of personal\rgrudges and vendettas. The caboclos struck out against those individuals\rwhom they saw as having wealth and power over them, most often being\rthose of European ancestry. Although not clearly defined enough to be\rcalled race and class warfare, the Cabanagem was definitely a war between\rthe haves and have-nots. The elite class suffered serious losses, as many died during the shelling of Belem or disappeared after fleeing the\rcity.\n<br>\rWhen most of the fighting had ended by 1836, the survivors from the\relite class slowly reestablished their economic control of the basin. In\rtime, they would again guide the reins of economic growth, but they remained\rextremely cautious about their relationship with the caboclos. As\rthe issue of colonization and settlement of new areas became a major topic\rof debate, the residual fear of the violent potential of the caboclos may\rwell have been one reason for the decision to bring foreign immigrants\rrather than resettle and subsidize the native paraenses. The elites had no\rintention of allowing the caboclos any opportunity for advancement.\n",

        "entry": "\nThe second rebellion, chronologically, was quite different in nature. It became known as the Farroupilha, a name used to characterize the radicals after the abdication of Pedro I, and took place in the southern province of Rio Grande do Sul. The province had over 100,000 inhabitants, and the capital, Porto Alegre, had, in 1830, a population of between 12,000 and 15,000. As in Para, slaves composed more or less 30 per cent of the total population. But Rio Grande do Sul had a very different social structure from the rest of Brazil. The historical circumstances of the formation of the province had led to a fusion of military status and landownership, and the militarized dominant class exercised almost total control over the subordinate groups in society. Moreover, the province had gone through an important economic transformation in the second decade of the century, moving from agriculture to livestock production. A charque industry also developed along the coast. The occupation of the Banda Oriental in 1817 had given a tremendous boost to the estancieiros. They not only bought land in what became the Cisplatine Province but also transferred vast numbers of cattle to Brazil. The loss of the Banda Oriental in 1828 had been a severe blow, although it did not stop the regular smuggling of cattle across the frontier. In fact, economic and political relations among the estancieiros of Rio Grande do Sul, Uruguay and the Argentine provinces of Entre Rios and Corrientes were an important factor in the rebellion of 1835. They formed a powerful group of caudillos in search of a political organization that could best suit their interests.\r<br>\rThe beginning of the revolt was not very different from that of the Cabanagem, in the sense that it turned around the reaction of local liberals against the formation of the caramuru Sociedade Militar in 1833 and against a president appointed by the regency. The president, who suspected secessionist plans among the local leaders, was overthrown in September 1835. Under the next president, himself a rich estancieiro, factions coalesced and in February 1836 open war broke out. In September 1836 the farroupilhas proclaimed the independence of the province under a republican government, although they were not able to keep control of the capital.In 1839, with the help  of a small naval task force organized by the Italian revolutionary, Giuseppe Garibaldi, they invaded the neighbouring province of Santa Catarina, where a shortlived republic was also proclaimed. The fight dragged on for ten years until an armistice was agreed in March 1845.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The local hacendados were successfully growing henequen\u2014sisal, a fibre-producing agave\u2014for export and had few ties with central Mexico. Quite naturally, Yucatan embraced federalism and in 1839 rebelled against Mexico with the help of Mayan soldiers, becoming for all practical purposes an independent state. In 1840, the American traveller, John L. Stephens, found the Indian peons submissive and humble. Two years later, after his second visit, he warned:\n<i><font style=\"color:#cc0000;\">\rWhat the consequences may be of finding themselves, after ages of servitude, once more in the possession of arms and in increasing knowledge of their physical strength is a question of momentous import to the people of that country, the solution of which no man can foretell.</font>\n<br>\n</i>\rStephen's forebodings were borne out five years later. In return for the service of Indian peasants as soldiers, the whites had promised to abolish or at least reduce parochial fees, to abolish the capitation tax payable by all Indian adults, and to give them free use of public and communal lands. None of these promises were fulfilled and the Mayas rebelled in the summer of 1847 with the aim of exterminating or at least expelling the white population. The revolt soon developed into full-scale war, known ever since as the War of the Castes. Mexico had just been defeated by the United States and, even had it wished to do so, was unable to send an army to Yucatan to suppress the revolt. In the cruel war which followed, the Indians almost succeeded in driving their enemies into the sea. In their despair, the whites went as far as to offer Yucatan to Great Britain, the United States, or, indeed, any country willing to protect them.\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"mapimages/castewaryucatan.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;column-span: all;COLSPAN=2;\">\n\n<br>\u2003\u2003\rWhile Yucatan was in the throes of this race war, Indian tribes, forced southward by the expansion of the United States, invaded the sparsely populated regions of northern Mexico, burning haciendas, villages and mining settlements, and indiscriminately killing their inhabitants. Again, the Mexican government was too weak to prevent these incursions.\n<br>\u2003\u2003\nSocial and ethnic revolt took a different form in central Mexico. Here the Indians did not form a compact, linguistic group and nor were they in a clear majority, as were the Mayas in Yucatan. However, deserters from the army, fugitives from justice, vagrants and similar elements, taking advantage of Mexico's military defeat and the chaos which followed, formed armed bands which began to terrorize the countryside. In at least one district, in the mountains of the states of Guanajuato, Queretaro and San Luis Potosi, a revolutionary agrarian movement developed. This so- called Sierra Gorda rebellion sought to give free land to hacienda tenants and peons, but the rebels were not strong enough to attack cities, and they had to be satisfied with the burning of haciendas. The Mexican ruling class, demoralized, embittered and divided, watched helplessly as the remnants of their once great country were beginning to fall apart.\n<br>\u2003\u2003\nFollowing the caste wars of 1847\u201455 they managed to set up an independent state in southern Yucatan and until 1901 resisted numerous attempts by federal troops to re-establish Mexican sovereignty. Moreover, armed with weapons they purchased in neighbouring British Honduras, they frequently ventured out to raid adjacent Mexican territories with relative impunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
