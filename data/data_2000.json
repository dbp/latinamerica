In 1986, Reagan dismantled the allowance of imported small gifts an remittances to Cuban relatives. In 1988, Reagan put up restrictions on subsidiaries making shipments to and from Cuba, which had been mainly through third party countries.\n<br>\nThroughout Reagan's term, the US Treasury was ordered to crack down on previously overlooked aspects of the embargo, including examining what special visa holders were doing in Cuba. Of particular interest were journalists, scholars, and lawyers. Numerous cases and lawsuits were filed to send the message that Cuban relations and trading were going to be strictly monitored.\n<br>\nThe Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 further restricted trade: Third party nations and foreign US-owned or operated subsidiaries were again forbidden from trading with Cuba, boats belonging to third party nations were disallowed from docking in the United States for 180 days after trading with Cuba, and the treasury department got the right to prosecute any violators, with fines of $1M for corporations, and $100K for civilians. It also  reinstated the denial of American aid to countries that provided assistance to Cuba.\n<br>\nThe CDA was met with a resounding disdain in the international community, leading to a UN resolution directed at the United States expressing a deep concern for the US extraterritorial legislation. The list of countries opposed to the CDA included Canada, Britain, France, Japan, Spain, Mexico, and Brazil. Despite its overwhelming unpopularity, the CDA was not be revoked.\n<br> \nFollowing the election of Bill Clinton, small reforms were passed, but nothing that really affected the overall policy. It wasn't until the passage of the Helms-Burton Act in March of 1996 that a big change was initiated in the Cuban sanctions. The act included the following:\n\n<br>\u2022 International Sanctions against the Castro Government. Economic embargo, any non-US company dealing economically with Cuba can be subjected to legal action and that company's leadership can be barred from entry into the United States. Sanctions may be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. This means that internationally operating companies have to choose between Cuba and the US, which is a much larger market.\n<br>\u2022 United States opposition against Cuban membership in international financial institutions.\n<br>\u2022 Television broadcasting from the United States to Cuba.\n<br>\u2022 Authorization of United States support for democratic and human rights groups and international observers.\n<br>\u2022 U.S. policy towards a transition government and a democratically elected government in Cuba. (Sanctions to be lifted when these things occur)\n<br>\u2022 Protection of property rights of certain United States nationals.\n<br>\u2022 Exclusion of certain aliens from the United States, primarily senior officials or major stock holders, and their families, of companies that do business in Cuba on property expropriated from American citizens.

The violence is expressed toward the disappeared, the prisoners, the tortured, the exiles, the lack of freedom of the press, etc. ... it is not only with the attacks against the rights of persons that we must deal. We must analyze also, in all the dimensions of this reality, the deep structural causes which generate these conflict situations. For that, the struggle for the dignity of the individual must consider society as much as the individual in all which has to do with the development of the rights of the people.\n<br>\n&quot;But this same continent and these same human beings live, besides, in the hope of making their own history. And to this immense task, where I humbly include myself, we take no more than our own hands and great faith.\n<br>\n&quot;To those of you also involved in this struggle on behalf of the poor, I want to bring you the image of this deeply absorbing situation and its significance for world peace.\n<br>\n&quot;Latin America does not see itself in the same way, but finds itself caught between an economic-political system and an international social system in profound transformation. Its image of violence reflects the violence of our contemporary world. Its injustices are bound up within an unjust international system, a system whose mechanisms, in the words of John Paul II, 'are mechanisms encountered impregnated not with an authentic humanism, but with materialism producing an international standard with the rich ever richer at the expense of the poor ever poorer'.\n<br>\n&quot;It is necessary to create the conditions that permit displacing the mechanisms which secure the domination of one country over another. I want to affirm, together with our Latin American pastors in the meeting at Puebla, that in the ability to live together, '... all human beings hold the common good as fundamental, consistent with the ever more fraternal realization of common dignity which does not use some persons as tools for the benefit of others, and that all be disposed to sacrifice for some particular good ends'. This common dignity necessarily implies the existence of liberty.\n<br>\n&quot;And for us liberty is that inalienable capacity that all humans alike have at their disposal.\n<br>\n&quot;This is the capacity that permits the building of communion and participation which encourage human beings to relate fully with the world, with their brothers and sisters and with God.\n<br>\n&quot;I see with concern that this new international system, marked as it is by the existence of great multinational corporations, is far from increasing participation and improving channels of expression for the majority. What is essential are new constructs that allow political participation, eliminating the distance between the governors and the governed, that support the privileges of minorities, and do not hold on to the old, the known and worn-out structures of injustice.&quot;</i>\n\n\n\n\n",

The Contras were originally known as the 15th of September Legion. Their earliest training came from Argentinian military intelligence, which ran death squads in that country and sponsored a Latin American conference of death squad leaders in 1980. That death squad network was also the Latin American branch of WACL.

As many as 10,000 Indians were killed and over 100,000 fled to Mexico as a result of Mont's &quot;Christian&quot; campaign.",

Sharp increases in military assistance to Honduras followed the buildup of United States troops and equipment in Honduras. In 1983 United States forces began a series of large- scale maneuvers in Honduras that not only provided joint training for United States and Honduran forces but also allowed the administration of Ronald W. Reagan to skirt congressional limits on military aid to that country and the Contras. Throughout the 1980s, the United States also built or improved military-related installations such as airfield, barracks, and radar stations. \n<br>\nIn February 1983, the United States and Honduras conducted a joint military exercise called Big Pine, which was the largest of its kind ever held in Honduras. A total of 1,600 United States military personnel and 4,000 Honduran soldiers participated in exercises designed to help Honduras improve its deployment techniques and logistical support in the field. United States Army elements provided mobility for Honduran forces and logistics and communications assistance. United States Navy elements included two landing ships and two landing craft. United States Air Force personnel participated in the coordination of landing and air supply operations. A number of training personnel, mostly from the United States Army, remained in the country to train the Honduran army in infantry tactics. Also during the exercises, a sizable radar installation staffed by over fifty United States Air Force technicians was placed south of Tegucigalpa. \n<br>\nThe number of United States advisers increased further in mid- 1983 when the United States and Honduras approved a new training agreement as an amendment to the 1954 military assistance agreement. The two countries constructed a military training facility, near Puerto Castilla on the Caribbean coast, at a cost of some US$250,000. The primary purpose of this facility, called the Regional Center for Military Training (Centro Regional de Entrenamiento Militar\u2014CREM), was to train Salvadoran ground forces, although Hondurans also received training. The center initially had about 125 United States Army Special Forces personnel, raising the total number of trainers in the country to approximately 270 in July 1983. \n<br>\nAlthough CREM closed in 1985, United States military advisers remained. Between 1983 and 1993, the United States and Honduras have carried out an almost continuous string of joint military maneuvers on Honduran soil. To facilitate the maneuvers and strengthen Honduras's military infrastructure, the Honduran government has built a network of roads, improved ports, and constructed additional airfields. \n<br>\nBetween August 1983 and February 1984, United States forces carried out Big Pine II, a considerably more extensive military exercise than the earlier Big Pine maneuvers, involving up to 5,000 United States military personnel. Extensive naval maneuvers involved two United States Navy aircraft carrier task forces, another task force led by the battleship U.S.S. New Jersey, and a landing by the United States Marines on the Caribbean coast during portions of the exercises. The purpose, according to a senior United States official, was to demonstrate the ability of United States military forces to operate in Central America and to persuade the Sandinista government of Nicaragua to desist from fomenting insurrection in the region.

Three U.S. Diplomats are implicated. d'Escoto goes on to become the president of the United Nations General Assembly in 2008.\n\n&quot;Reagan in fact was an international outlaw. He came to the Presidency of the United States shortly after Samosa, a Dictator that the U.S. has imposed over Nicaragua for practically half a century; had been deposed by Nicaraguan Nationalists under the leadership of the Sandinista Liberation Front. To Reagan Nicaragua had to be re-conquered. He blamed Carter for having lost Nicaragua, as if Nicaragua ever belonged to anyone else other than the Nicaraguan people. That was then the beginning of this war that Reagan invented, and mounted and financed and directed, the Contra War. About which he continually lied to the People. Helping the United States people to be the most ignorant people around the world. I said ignorant, I don't say not intelligent. But the most ignorant people around the world about what the United States does abroad. People don't even begin to see \u2014 if they did, they would rebel. And so, he lied to the people, as Bush lies to the people today and as they push on, thinking that the United States is above every law, human or divine. And we took the United States, Reagan's United States, his government to court, the World Court. I was Foreign Minister at that time here in Nicaragua. I was responsible for that. And the United States government received the harshest sentence, the harshest condemnation ever in the history of world justice. In spite of the fact that the United States since the early 1920's has been proclaiming to the world that one of the proofs of its moral superiority as compared to other countries around the world is the fact that it abides by the international law and was obedient to the world court when the United States was brought to the world court in Nicaragua and received the condemnation that the United States failed to heed the sentence and they till owe Nicaragua by now must be between 20,000 and $30,000 million at the time when we left government that the damages caused by that Reagan war was over $17 billion, and this, according to very moderate estimators of damage, people from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, people from Harvard University and from Oxford and from the University of Paris basically this is the team that was pulled together to estimate the damage. The United States was ordered to pay for the damage. Bush never even wanted to talk to me about it. I said, &quot;Well, let's have a meeting so that you comply with your sentence of the court.&quot; He said to me in two different letters that there was nothing to talk about.\nSo, Reagan did damage to Nicaragua beyond the imaginations of the people who are hearing me now.

The clampdown on the protesters and looters was harsh after Tuesday the 28th, as the military was called out on the streets in several major cities and a curfew was set\u2014measures that had not been used in Venezuela in several generations. \n\nWith the police and National Guard unable to restore order, Perez called out the army on the night of Monday, Feb. 27, and the troops brutally cracked down on the rioters, who were acting without clear objectives or political leadership of any kind. \n\nIt is true as well, as journalists witnessed at the time, that the army also attempted on a number of occasions to at least impose order among the chaos, having looters stand in organised lines that filed in and out of supermarkets and stores, and ensuring that they only took food and did not cause damages. \n\n&quot;It was the first breakdown of the institutional pact under which democracy had functioned since 1958, a kind of collective decision to break with the prevailing state of law. But it was also a great national failure, a fight without winners, which remains a huge open wound,&quot; said sociologist Tulio Hernandez. \n\n The end result: hundreds of people killed, around 2,000 injured and more than 150 million dollars in damages to shops and businesses. \nOn the 28th, Andres Perez suspended a number of constitutional civil liberties as the country had been effectively shut down within two days.

One of the most notorious international terrorists, Posada had escaped from a Venezuelan prison, where he had been held for the Cubana airliner bombing, with the aid of Jorge Mas Canosa, a Miami businessman who was the head of the tax-exempt Cuban-American National Foundation (CANF). Posada went from Venezuela to El Salvador, where he was put to work at the Ilopango military air base to help organize US terrorist attacks against Nicaragua under Oliver North's direction.\n\nPosada has described in detail his terrorist activities and the funding for them from exiles and CANF in Miami, but felt secure that he would not be investigated by the FBI. He was a Bay of Pigs veteran, and his subsequent operations in the 1960s were directed by the CIA. When he later joined Venezuelan intelligence with CIA help, he was able to arrange for Orlando Bosch, an associate from his CIA days who had been convicted in the US for a bomb attack on a Cuba-bound freighter, to join him in Venezuela to organize further attacks against Cuba. An ex-CIA official familiar with the Cubana bombing identifies Posada and Bosch as the only suspects in the bombing, which Bosch defended as &quot;a legitimate act of war.&quot; Generally considered the &quot;mastermind&quot; of the airline bombing, Bosch was responsible for thirty other acts of terrorism, according to the FBI. He was granted a presidential pardon in 1989 by the incoming Bush I administration after intense lobbying by Jeb Bush and South Florida Cuban-American leaders, overruling the Justice Department, which had found the conclusion &quot;inescapable that it would be prejudicial to the public interest for the United States to provide a safe haven for Bosch [because] the security of this nation is affected by its ability to urge credibly other nations to refuse aid and shelter to terrorists.&quot;",

The military program (arms, training, intelligence infrastructure) was in place in late 1999, but &quot;the Colombian govern-ment has yet to present a coherent social investment program&quot; as of mid-2000, and few governments are &quot;willing to climb aboard what is widely perceived as an American project to clean up its backyard,&quot; by means that are familiar to those who do not choose what has been called &quot;intentional ignorance.&quot;\n<br>\nThe Colombian Commission of Jurists reported in September 1999 that the rate of killings had increased by almost 20 percent over the preceding year, and that the proportion attributable to the paramilitaties had risen from 46 percent in 1995 to almost 80 percent in 1998, continuing through 1999. The Colombian government's Human Rights Ombudsman's Office (Defensoria del Pueblo) reported a 68 percent increase in massacres in the first half of 1999 as compared to the same period of 1998, reaching more than one a day, overwhelmingly attributed to paramilitaries. Daniel Bland, a human rights researcher who worked in Colombia through most of the 1990s, concludes that in the past three years alone, &quot;more than a million people have been forced from their homes in the countryside, and between 5,000 and 7,000 unarmed peasants have been slaughtered by right-wing paramilitaries.&quot; Of nine people he interviewed for a documentary on human rights in 1997\u2014professors, journalists, priests, human rights workers\u2014&quot;three have since been murdered by paramilitary gunmen; four have fled with their families after receiving death threats.&quot; UNICEF and the Colombian Human Rights Information Bureau CODRES estimate that in June-August 1999 alone, 200,000 more people were driven from their homes.",

The embargo came under considerable domestic criticism as well, on the grounds that it harms US exporters and investors\u2014the embargo's only victims, according to the standard picture in the US; Cubans are unaffected. Investigations by US specialists tell a different story. Thus, a detailed study by the American Association for World Health concluded that the embargo had severe health effects, and only Cuba's remarkable health care system had prevented a &quot;humanitarian catastrophe&quot;; this has received virtually no mention in the US.\n\nThe embargo has effectively barred even food and medicine. In 1999 the Clinton administration eased such sanctions for all countries on the official list of &quot;terrorist states,&quot; apart from Cuba, singled out for unique punishment. ",
