Additional demands tried to improve the conditions of all Cubans: the expansion of compulsory free education from 8 to 14 years, abolition of the death penalty, establishment of an 8-hr work day and priority for Cubans in employment.\n\n\n<br>\n&quot;Our motto is 'Cuba for the Cubans,'&quot; said an editorial in Prevision on September 15 1908.\n<br>\nIn May 1909, while serving as President of the Cuban Senate, Morua Delgado introduced a law in the senate that banned political parties based on race or class. This was a direct attack on the Partido Independiente de Color, and was known as the Morua Law.\n<br>\nThree years later a demonstration sponsored by the Independientes grew into demonstrations in which Afro-Cubans attacked and burned foreign-owned properties.  In May of 1912, PIC organizers launched an armed demonstration seeking legalization in time for November's elections.

In\r1896 marines attacked Corimo to 'protect American interests during\rpolitical unrest'; in 1898 US troops landed at San Juan del Sur; in 1899\rthey were in action in Bluefields and San Juan del Norte, all under the\rrubric of 'protecting American lives and bridges'. Nicaraguans should\rhave understood by this time that people in Washington, not Managua,\rwould control their destiny.\n<br>\nNevertheless, some Nicaraguans took sovereignty seriously. In the\rearly 1900s Nicaraguan President Jose Samos Zelaya (who assumed\rdictatorial powers) committed a bold and, as it turned out, rather\rimprudent act. This crusty authoritarian nationalist refused to cede to\rthe United States exclusive rights to build a canal, which would have\rincluded US control of a strip of Nicaraguan territory. Instead, he invited\rEuropean and Japanese concerns to aid in building an interoceanic link\rto connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. He also asked the Bank of\rEngland - not a New York bank - for a loan.\r<br>\rUS Secretary of State Philander C. Knox took umbrage. Highly\rconscious of the Monroe Doctrine and the Roosevelt Corrolary to\rthat document, which asserted US 'international police power' in the\rhemisphere, Knox branded Zelaya's moves as opening the door to\r'European infiltration'. He angrily denounced the Nicaraguan president\rfor even daring to think about entering into financial transactions With\rany but US banks. Knox's subsequent demands on the Nicaraguan\rgovernment belied even the thinnest respect for its sovereignty: a ninety-nine\ryear lease for a naval base on the Gulf of Fonseca and permanent\raccess rights for a canal through Nicaragua. In words that presaged\rReagan administration rhetoric some seventy years later, Philander Knox,\rin 1909, accused Zelaya of 'keeping Central America in tension and\rturmoil'.\n<br>\rThe stubborn Zelaya, taking seriously the fiction of Nicaraguan\rindependence, refused to accede to Knox's commands. The US government retaliated by destabilizing his regime. During the course of\rsubverting Zelaya's government, two US secret agents were caught <i>in\rflagrante delicto</i> trying to dynamite Nicaraguan bridges. Zelaya ordered\rthem to be tried. Despite US protestations, they were convicted and\rshot. Knox used the incident to sever diplomatic relations and send\rmarines to Bluefields.\n<br>\rKnox's plan worked. As was the case in subsequent episodes of\rdestablization, the government and the private sector cooperated. United\rFruit Company donated $1 million toward the overthrow of the Zelaya\rgovernment. Zelaya was forced into exile and replaced by Adolfo Diaz\rwho, obedient to Washington's commands, canceled concessions to\rnon-US firms and opened the door to the exaggerated claims of US\rbanks, which then transferred to their own coffers more than half of\rNicaragua's national bank assets. In 1914, as the Panama Canal opened\rto ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific, President Diaz made\ran offer to the United States: S3 million in exchange for 'rights in\nperpetuity' to any land needed to build a canal through the San Juan\rroute in southern Nicaragua. The $3 million was handled by US-appointed\rcommissioners to repay foreign loans, mostly to US banks,\rso that a mere pittance actually found its way into the Nicaraguan\rTreasury. The canal was never built, but the United States acquired a\rrenewable lease for a naval base on the Corn Islands and on the Gulf\rof Fonseca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The hit-and-run guerrilla war tactics of Augusto Sandino, who\rbetween 1927 and 1933 fought the U.S. Marines in Nicaragua to a\rdraw, further taught them that political nationalism was an equally\rpowerful force and that attempts to counter it with increased militarism\rwould only lead to a deterioration of American influence.\rU.S. troops had been in and out of Nicaragua a number of times\rsince the late nineteenth century. In 1916 Calvin Coolidge, who despite\rhis charisma deficit fancied himself a robust expansionist in the\rTheodore Roosevelt mold, once again dispatched an expedition, this\rtime to quell a budding civil war but also to sequester the kind of\rrevolutionary nationalism that was spreading throughout Mexico.\rHis actions backfired.\r<br>\rDespite overwhelming asymmetrical firepower, including advances\rin aerial warfare, Nicaragua proved to be the United States's\rfirst third-world quagmire. Sandino harassed the Americans not just\rwith attack-and-retreat guerrilla tactics that inflicted a deadly toll\rbut with ideas. As head of a self-styled Defending Army of Nicaraguan\rNational Sovereignty, the rebel leader\u0335who took as his official seal\ran image of a peasant with a raised machete about to decapitate a\rcaptured marine\u2014tapped into widespread Latin American resentment.\rHis brand of patriotism esteemed the dark-skinned, impoverished\rpeasant culture that prevailed throughout Mesoamerica md\rmuch of South America, while vilifying not only Yankees but their\rwell-heeled local allies, or, as Sandino called them, vendepatrias\u2014country\rsellers. &quot;Pro-Nicaraguan committees&quot; sprang up throughout\rLatin America, with Sandino's David-against-Goliath struggle\rcoming to embody a century of aggression and arrogance. Manifestos,\n\ngrassroots meetings, editorials, and ever larger street protests denounced Washington's war in Nicaragua. Newspapers published\rregular articles on the crisis and ran photographs provided by\rSandino of captured, executed, and mutilated marines, contributing\rto a sense of U.S. vulnerability. His appeal extended to the United\rStates, where he coordinned his public relations campaign with the\ractivities of the All-American Anti-Imperialist League, sending his\rbrother Socrates on a national speaking tour. In Europe, a Mexican\rdelegate to the 1929 International Congress against Colonialism and\rImperialism waved a tattered American flag captured by Sandino's\rtroops to a loud round of cheers and applause. Even London, then\rin the process of spreading its control over much of the Middle East,\rtook great pleasure re in condemning America's actions as &quot;frankly imperialistic.&quot;\n<br>\rTensions came to a head at the Sixth Pan-American Conference,\rheld in Havana in early 1928. By the time of the meeting, panAmericanism,\rthe idea that the American republics shared common\rideals and political interests, was in effect moribund. But it was trotted out every few years in an international forum where Latin American delegates mostly submitted to Washington's directives while\rsilently seething about the latest violation of national sovereignty\u2014in Panama, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Venezuela, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, take your pick. Proceedings in Havana moved according to script. The closing ceremony was not intended\rfor debate, yet El Salvador raised the issue of Washington's military\rinterventions, opening the floodgates of criticism. The gallery audience\rapplauded each recounting of old and new grievances and\rhissed at the tepid defense of US. policy offered by its envoy. This\rcourt rebellion took place in the shadow of Sandino's war, which\ron the eve of the conference had scored a number of impressive\rvictories. The rebel was not directly mentioned, although one Latin\rAmerican daily after another read the diplomacy in light of the\rfighting in Nicaragua.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Nor in Paraguay, as we have seen;\rbut the railroads built by the Paraguayan state, with the help of European\rtechnicians, passed into British hands after the defeat. The other countries'\rrailroads went the same way without producing a single centavo of new\rinvestment; furthermore, the state contracts took care to assure the companies a\rminimum profit level, to avoid possible unpleasant surprises. Decades later, at\rthe end of World War II, when the railroads yielded no more dividends and had\rfallen into relative disuse, the public authorities got them back. Almost all of\rthe states bought the scrap iron from the British and thus nationalized the\rcompanies' losses.\n<br>\rWhen the railroads were booming, the British concerns had often obtained\rconsiderable land concessions on either side of the tracks, in addition to the\rrailbeds themselves and the right to build new branch lines. The land was an\radditional business bonanza. A fabulous gift to the Brazilian railway in 1911\rled to the burning of countless huts and the eviction or death of peasant\rfamilies in the concession area. It was this that triggered off the &quot;Contestado&quot;\rrevolt, one of the greatest outbursts of popular fury in Brazilian history.</i>\n<br>\nThe Contestado movement occurred in the south of the country in a\rfrontier area disputed by the states of Parana and Santa Catarina. It began\rin 1911 under the leadership of Jose Maria, who died in the first clashes\rand was heralded as a saint by the rebels of the Contestado. Unlike\rCanudos, the movement did not limit itself to one particular centre, but\rshifted to various points in the region, under pressure from military\rforces. The rebellion was put down in late 1915, when rebel strongholds\rwere attacked and destroyed by 6,000 soldiers from the army and the\rpolice force, assisted by 1,000 civilians who joined in the process of\rrepression.\n<br>\nIn considering the principal social movements in the interior of Brazil\rduring the First Republic, Joazeiro, a city in the south of the state of\rCeara, which became the centre of activities of the priest Cicero Romao\rBatista between 1872 and 1924, also deserves mention. There are many\rcommon features between events in Joazeiro and the Canudos and\rContestado movements. For example, from the point of view of the\rhistory of the transformation of the Catholic church in Brazil, particularly\rin the north-east, Canudos and Joazeiro were manifestations of similar developments.\rOn the other hand, when considering social movements as\rmanifestations of rebellion, Joazeiro has little in common with the other\rtwo movements. Although Padre Cicero clashed continuously with the\recclesiastical authorities, and at times with factions of the oligarchy, his\rmovement for better or worse fell within the system of domination\rwhich prevailed during the First Republic. Put simply, the city of\rJoazeiro can be seen as an area controlled by a <i>priest-coronel</i>, who had a\rconsiderable degree of influence within the political oligarchy, particularly\rafter 1909 when Padre Cicero began to involve himself directly in\rthe political struggles.\n<br>\rThe Canudos and Contestado movements were attempts to create an\nalternative way of life, and were considered sufficiently dangerous for\rboth to be brutally crushed by military forces. This does not mean that\rthey were totally opposed to the power structure of the coronets. Before\rsettling in Canudos, Antonio Conselheiro had been a practising member\rof the Catholic church, living an ascetic, nomadic life. He summoned\rthe people together in order to build or rebuild churches. He built\rwalls around cemeteries, and he showed concern for the small parish\rchurches of the interior. There is evidence that at this stage he was well\rlooked upon by certain coronets, for whom his disciplined followers built\rroads and dams. The village of Canudos itself did not depart very much\rfrom the traditional pattern of settlement in the interior. There was a\rcertain degree of social and economic differentiation, a considerable\rdegree of trade with the surrounding area, and religious links with the\rpriests of the neighbouring parishes. Canudos was also a source of votes\rand influence at election time.\n<br>\rThe instigators of the Contesdado movement were the followers of a\rcoronet who was a member of the opposition and seen as a friend of the\rpoor. Others of varying origins joined this group, among them those\rwho were the victims of the process of modernization in both urban and\rrural areas: rural workers driven off the land by the construction of a\rrailway and a timber plant, people who had been recruited for railway\rconstruction from among the unemployed of large cities and then\rabandoned at the end of their contract, and criminals who were at large in\rthe region. However, the village settlements which grew up during the\rContestado, with their emphasis on equality and fraternity, clashed with\restablished social values, and assumed characteristics which were clearly\rmessianic. This can be seen, among other features, through the way\rmany of the members of the Contestado remained loyal to the monarchy\rwhich, it has been argued, represented an eschatological kingdom more\rthan a political institution. The theme of the monarchy, whether\rbecause of the form it took or because of the period in which the\rContestado movement occurred, was not exploited to any extent by the\rgovernment. In contrast, the earlier monarchism of Antonio\rConselheiro, with its attacks on the Republic, responsible for the\rintroduction of civil marriage and for the taking of cemeteries away from\rthe control of the church, took more concrete forms. As a result it was a\rmobilizing factor against Canudos in the urban centres, at a time when\nthe possibility of the restoration of the monarchy was seen as a real threat.\rCanudos, Contestado and Joazeiro were not episodes devoid of\rsignificance, nor were they isolated expressions by an ignorant rural\rpopulation in contrast to the centres of civilization on the coast. In\rdifferent degrees, these movements can be linked to changes in the\rCatholic church, to socio-economic changes in their respective areas, and\rto the political development of the nation itself. Their particular strength\ras a demonstration of popular religious belief cannot be ignored.\rNevertheless, as attempts at independent organization on the part of the\rrural population, they effectively illustrate the severe limitations of such\rorganization during the period of the First Republic.\n",

        "entry": "The urban working class found little in common with the middle class.\nThey resented the economic privileges of factory owners, landholders,\nand exporters, as well as the Radical party's patronage of the middle\nclass. Strikes became more disruptive as industry attempted to deal with\nmaterial shortages caused by World War I. The war disrupted coal imports\nfrom England, forcing industry to operate at reduced levels. Railway\ncompanies struggled to maintain schedules while imports plunged. Real\nwages fell between 1914 and 1917 by a third as shortages forced industries\nto dismiss workers. Use of agricultural wastes compressed into briquettes\nfor heating and cooking symbolized wartime hardships and the decline\nin living standards. Frustrated workers clashed with factory owners\nas strikes became violent. Employers with links with vigilante groups\nformed the Labor Association (Asociacion del Trabajo) to break strikes with\nreplacement workers. The meatpacking strike of December 1917 ended\nbloodily, as the police stormed union headquarters armed with sabers\nslashing anyone unlucky enough to be in the way. A railroad strike earlier\nin the year resulted in damaged and burned equipment. The government\nusually intervened against strikes mounted by supposed radicals,\nwhile moderate union leaders often received President Yrigoyen's support. In the\ncase of the rail strike the president imposed a generous contract on the\ncompanies, including an eight-hour day, annual paid vacations, and sick\nand overtime pay. Yrigoyen's tactics undercut the Socialists and pushed\nthe Anarchists into confrontation, with grim consequences. Two violent\nclashes, the January 1919 Semana Tragica (Tragic Week) and the Patagonia\nTragica (1921-1922), rank among the worst labor disturbances of the early\ntwentieth century.\n<br>\nThe Semana Tragica began with a strike against a metalwork factory by\nan Anarchist union late in 1918. Fighting broke out between strikebreakers\nand workers. Heavy-handed police tactics added to the violence.\nOver the course of the next several diays, events spun out of control. \nThe Anarchist Labor Federntion's call for a genernl strike provided the pretext\nfor vigilantes, who subsequently provided the core of Liga Patriotica\nArgentina (Argentine Patriotic League). Thugs swept into the Jewish\nbarrio of Buenos Aires (popular perceptions associated Jews with\nAnarchists) and by the time the destruction ended, 700 to 1,500 people\ndied and another 4,000 had been beaten or injured. The army, without\norders from the president, assumed control of the capital. Property damage\nand lost production and wages cast the economy millions of pesos.\nYrigoyen offered to arbitrate between the parties. In the end, an alarmed\ngovernment forced the company to settle the strike. Lingering police and\nvigilante violence slowly played itself out and the Semana Tragica ended.\nUpper class perceptions that the government lacked the will or ability to\ndiscipline workers resul ted in the forma tion of the Liga Patriotica Argentina.\nThe LPA responded to fears that foreign ideologies, and labor organiziltions\ninfluenced by them, would shred the social fabric and damage the\neconomy. Manuel Carles established the League in 1919 with the idea of\nusing physical force to root out radicals. Organized as a paramilitary organization,\nthe LPA drew much of its leadership from the Jockey Club. The\nleague's mission to indoctrinate the working class to counter radicalism\nhad the support of the Church, the elite, and the middle class. A female\ndivision labored to bring the League's message to working-women. While\nthe upper and middle classes becnme more concerned, labor became\nincreasingly desperate and militant.\n<br>\nIn Patagonia, violence came on the heels of a momentary improvement\nin working conditions. In late 1920, employers, mainly British sheep operators,\norganized as the Sociedad Rural de Santa Cruz, responded positively\nto demands for better wnges and conditions. Workers wanted a limit\non the number of occupants per hut, a mattress for each person, and\nsalaries in hard currency to protect the value of wages. Unfortunately, a\ndrop in the price of wool on world markets led to deterioration of labor\nand living conditions. A general strike drew a sharp line between owners\nand workers. The issue cnme down to which side would bear the\nburden of hard times. Angry workers seized property, while landowners\nformed white guards to defend their interests. Local Radical party officials\nsided with the owners. Unbalanced reports picked up by the press\npresented an alarmist and distorted picture. After local muscle failed to\nbreak the strike, the army arrived in early 1921, believing that it faced an\nAnarchist insurrection. The Tenth Cavalry, commanded by Lt. Colonel\nHector Varela assisted by LPA members, shot suspected Anarchists in\ncold blood, tortured strikers, and dumped their bodies into mass graves.\nAfter some 2,000 victims, the strike collapsed. In a gruesome aftermath,\nColonel Varela died in a bomb blast, his assassin subsequently murdered\nby a guard, who then in turn died violently: a chain of death that shook\nthe nation.",

Civil-military relations had not been smooth since the early days of the Old Republic, and in 1922 several hundred officer cadets seized army installations to demand reforms. Their revolt was put down brutally, and those who survived were jailed or fled into exile.

Farabundo Marti, killed during the purge, has also left a legacy into the eighties as well: the rebels fighting the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador called themselves the FMLN, the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front&quot;  ",

In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.&quot; Two years later, Butler blows the whistle on the Business Plot, an attempt by Wall Street barons to enlist Butler into leading a fascist coup in the United States.

He once told European joumalists, &quot;You Germans were very intelligent.

U.S. State Department cables indicate D'Aubuisson &quot;planned and ordered the assassination of the late Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero.&quot; It is believed he was behind the White Warriors Union (UGB), whose slogan was &quot;Be patriotic - kill a priest.&quot; In 1989 six priests were slain and Cristiani soon admitted his U.S. trained soldiers had committed the murders. Yet, although assassinations of priests are notable, 70,000 other civilians have been killed by the Salvadoran military and the death squads since 1980.",
