The coup to overthrow Torres, led by U.S. trained officer and Gulf Oil beneficiary Hugo Banzer, had direct support from Washington. When Banzer's forces had a breakdown in radio communications, U.S. Air Force Major Robert Lundin placed the U.S. Air Force radio at their disposal. Once in power, Banzer began a reign of terror. Schools were shut down as hotbeds of &quot;political subversive agitation provoked by anarchists opposed to the new institutional order,&quot; the Soviet Embassy was closed, and Banzer raised a foreign loan to pay Gulf Oil compensation. Within two years, 2,000 people were arrested and tortured without trial. \n<br>\nAs in Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil, the native Indians were forced off their land and deprived of tribal identity. Tens of thousands of white South Africans were enticed to immigrate with promises of the land stolen from the Indians. Migration Under Secretary Guido Strauss told the U.N. the goal was to create a &quot;white Bolivia.&quot; When Catholic clergy tried to aid the Indians, the regime, with CIA help, launched terrorist attacks against them, and this &quot;Banzer Plan&quot; became a model for similar anti-Catholic actions throughout Latin America.\nAfter his dictatorship, Banzer is elected president in 1997 and serves until 2001, resigning because of cancer.",

His new regime was recognized in a flash by President Eisenhower. Under Batista, U.S. interests flourished and little was said about democracy. With the loyal support of Batista, Mafioso boss Meyer Lansky developed Havana into an international drug port. Cabinet offices were brought and sold and military officials made huge sums on smuggling and vice rackets. Havana became a fashionable hot spot where America's rich and famous clinked cocktails with mobsters. As the gap between the rich and poor grew wider, the poor grew impatient. In 1953, Fidel Castro led an armed group of rebels in a failed uprising on the Moncada army barracks. Fidel temporarily fled the country and Batista struck back with a vengeance. Freedom of speech was curtailed and &quot;subversive&quot; teachers, lawyers and public officials were fired from their jobs. Death squads tortured and killed thousands of &quot;communists.&quot; Batista was assisted in his crackdown by Lansky and other members of organized crime who believed Castro would jeopardize their gambling and drug trade.

Its Classic manifestation occurred\nbetween ad 300 and 900 in the Peten jungle of northern Guatemala, though\nit is believed that Maya culture may have originated in around 1000 bc on\nthe coast of the Gulf of Mexico in the area near Veracruz, which also saw\nthe rise of Olmec culture. If so, Maya culture would have been remotely\ncognate with the Aztec.\n<br>\nClassic Maya society fell victim to the mysterious decline that first afflicted\nTeotihuacan. By the middle of the eighth century the Classic sites in the\nPeten had been abandoned. In about ad 900 a Post-Classic Maya culture\nemerged at the northern tip of the Yucatan peninsula; this was the result of\na fusion with elements of central Mexican culture brought to the Yucatan\nby Toltec invaders, who conquered Yucatan and made their capital at\nChichen Itza, introducing new styles of architecture and art. The power of\nChichen Itza had declined by the thirteenth century and it was succeeded by\na new empire, whose centre was at Mayapan, but this too had disintegrated\ninto smaller states by the time the Spaniards arrived.\n<br>\n\nThe economy of the Mayas was based on maize, which was cultivated by\nslash-and-burn methods that exhausted the soil within a short period. A\nconsequence of this form of agriculture was a tendency for peasants to live\nin makeshift settlements of pole and thatch rather than in villages. Maya\ncities were therefore less concentrated than those in central Mexico, and were\nprimarily religious and administrative centres, where the priesthood and the\nnobility lived, though it appears that there was more residential settlement\nby the common people than was previously thought, especially in the main\ncities of northern Yucatan like Chichen Itza and Mayapan.\n<br>\nMaya kingdoms were ruled by a leader with religious as well as political\nauthority; society was divided into a class of commoners on the one hand\nand an upper class of priests, warriors and administrators on the other.\n'Empires' were created when a kingdom was able to exact tribute and labour\nfrom other smaller states. Like the Aztecs, the Mayas believed that a succession\nof worlds had been created and destroyed, and that the present era would\nalso have an apocalyptic ending. To put off this calamity they sacrificed\nhuman beings and practiced various forms of expiation. Their concern with\nthe fate of the cosmos produced a complex calendrical system and a well-\ndeveloped mathematics, which discovered the concept of zero several centuries before any other people in history. Hieroglyphic writing appears on stelae, on temple walls and doorways, and in a number of codices; otherwise\nMaya culture was oral and rich in mythology, of which something has been\npreserved in the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the Quiche Maya of\nGuatemala, which was written in the European alphabet from oral sources\nafter the Spanish Conquest. In architecture the Mayas surpassed other Amer-Indian civilizations; they were highly skilled in stone sculpture and mural painting, as is evidenced by the frescoes at Bonampak in Chiapas.\n",

Their myths relate how\ntheir first ruler, Manco Capac, brought the tribe to that valley either from\nthe shores of Lake Titicaca or, in another version, from the 'windows' or\ncaves at Paccari-Tambo, a place some eighteen miles south-east of Cuzco.\nLike Quetzalcoatl for the Toltecs and Aztecs, the mythical figure of Manco\nCapac was revered as the bringer of civilization to the world; he was also\nworshipped for being a direct descendant of the Sun God. a family connection\nwhich gave Inca rulers a quasi-divine status.\n<br>\nIn the late fourteenth century the Incas subjugated the other tribes in\nthe Cuzco valley, and their imperial career began in earnest in 1438, when the\ngreat conqueror. Yupanqui Inca Pachacuti. 'the Transformer', ascended the\nthrone Between 1438 and 1463 he extended Inca rule to the region of Lake\nTiticaca, and thence north-west. Other conquests by both Pachacuti and his\nson Topa Inca brought northern territories as far as Quito under Inca control.\nPachacuti it was who laid the foundations of the well-organized Inca state\ncentred upon Cuzco, a holy city which possessed the imposing Temple of\nthe Sun representing the very source of Inca power. In 1471 Pachacuti was\nsucceeded by Topa Inca, who, having already subdued the great Chimu\nkingdom in the north, ventured south into present-day Chile, establishing\nthe limit of Inca power at the River Maule in the territory of the Araucanian\nIndians. From 1493 the next supreme Inca. Huayna Capac, became involved\nin an extended campaign against rebellious ethnic kingdoms on the northern\nfrontier zones, especially around Quito. Upon Huayna Capac's death some\ntime between 1525 and 1528, his natural son Atahuallpa seized these frontier\nterritories with the help of several important generals and launched a coup\nd'etat against the legitimate successor, his half-brother Huascar. It was during\nthe ensuing civil war that Francisco Pizarro happened to arrive in the\nkingdoms of the Sun.\n<br>\nIn less than a hundred years the Incas had built the most formidable empire\nin the Western Hemisphere. Like that of the Aztecs, their dominion was\ncharacterized essentially by the levying of tribute from scores of subject\nkingdoms and tribes. But the Incas went much further than the Aztecs in\ndeveloping a centralized bureaucratic state at the service of a supreme ruling\nclass. In this the physical peculiarities of the Andean region were directly\ninfluential.\n<br>\n",

The Indians received them as if they were their friends and relatives showing every mark of respect andaffection, supplying them every day with food, the best that could be got. It is the generous custom of all the Indians in the New World to giveliberally to meet the needs of the Spaniards from whatever they may have.These men began to make a large house of wood in which they could all live as this was what they had alleged they had come to do. When thetime came to apply palm leaves to the supports and some way up the walls had been covered so that those without could not see within, theSpaniards said that they wanted to finish the house quickly and so put many Indians inside to help while the Spaniards went outside and drew their swords to prevent any Indians leaving. Then they began to threaten the defenceless Indians with death should they attempt to escape.They bound the Indians as prisoners while some, forcing their way out, were cut to pieces by the Spaniards.Some who had managed to escape though wounded, and others from the pueblo who had not entered the house, seized their bows and arrowsand retired to another building in the pueblo to defend themselves. When one or two hundred of the Indians were inside holding the gate, theSpaniards set fire to the house and burnt them all alive.

Furious, Enriwuillo consulted the church fathers in the capital, and they approached the royal Audencia (government council) with Enriquillo's demands for justice. Although the Spanish officials in the capital sympathized with the cacique and order Mencia's release, Enriquillo was forced to take their letter back to Vadillo, who threatened to jail him or put him in the stocks if her pursued the issue.

The Carib were found throughout the islands, but specifically populated the Lesser Antilles, while the\nArawak chiefly inhabited the Greater Antilles. When these indigenous peoples\nwere first encountered, the Spanish simply called them indios or identified them according to the name of their respective chiefs, villages, or island location. The name Taino, which came into common use only in the\nearly decades of the twentieth century and by which these tribal groups are generally known today was assigned to them by historians and anthropologists to refer to the entire indigenous population of the western Caribbean region.\nIn 1498, in an attempt to placate discontented colonists on the island of\nHispaniola, Christopher Columbus distributed to each them a parcel of land\nand the preexisting Indian communities on each.

Ponce de leon ordered that six thousand be\nshot, but many fled the island. The following year, forty slaves owned by\nDiego Colon, the son of Christopher Columbus, resisted for several months\nbefore finally being caught and executed. The Dominican friars on Hispanola,\ndisheartened by the slow extermination of the Arawak, suggested that slaves,\nboth white and black , should be imported to the islands. In 1512, in order to\ndiscourage Portuguese slave smuggling and in response to the writings of the\nDominican friars, the Spanish government began to grant licenses to bring\nslaves directly from Africa to the Americas.\nIn 1527, the first major slave rebellion occurred in Puerto Rico as dozens\nof slaves, likely of both African and indigenous origin, fought against the\nSpanish colonists in a brief and ultimately ill-fated revolt. The few slaves\nwho escaped during this uprising relreated into the mountains where they\nresided as maroons wilh surviving Taino. Similar uprisings continued until the nineteenth century when slavery was finally abolished on Puerto Rico. As several areas of the island were only sparsely settled during these subsequent revolts, many slaves preferred flight into the countryside and life as maroons with the inidigenous people rather than open revolt.",

In the independence period the area, now a part of Bolivia, still had a larger population than what is now Argentina. A century and a half later Bolivia's population is almost six times smaller than Argentina's.\n<br>\nPotosian society, sick with ostentation and extravagance, left Bolivia with only a vague memory of its splendors, of the ruins of its churches and palaces, and of 8 million Indian corpses. Any one of the diamonds encrusted in a rich caballero's shield was worth more than what an Indian could earn in his whole life under the mitayo, (A mitayo is an Indian who pays a mita. or tribute, usually in the form of forced labor in public works, especially the mines) but the caballero took off with the diamonds. If it were not a futile exercise, Bolivia\u2014now one of the world's most poverty-stricken countries\u2014could boast of having nourished the wealth of the wealthiest. In our time Potosi is a poor city in a poor Bolivia: &quot;The city which has given most to the world and has the least,&quot; as an old Potosian lady, enveloped in a mile of alpaca shawl, told me when we talked on the Andalusian patio of her two-century-old house. Condemned to nostalgia, tortured by poverty and cold, Potosi remains an open wound of the colonial system in America: a still audible &quot;J'accuse.&quot; \n<br>\nIn three centuries Potosi's Cerro Rico consumed 8 million lives. The Indians, including women and children, were torn from their agricultural communities and driven to the Cerro. Of every ten who went up into the freezing wilderness, seven never returned. Luis Capoche, an owner of mines and mills, wrote that &quot;the roads were so covered with people that the whole kingdom seemed on the move.&quot; In their communities the Indians saw &quot;many afflicted women returning without husbands and with many orphaned children&quot; and they knew that &quot;a thousand deaths and disasters&quot; awaited them in the mines. The Spaniards scoured the countryside for hundreds of miles for labor. Many died on the way, before reaching Potosi, but it was the terrible work conditions in the mine that killed the most people. Soon after the mine began operating, in 1550, the Dominican monk Domingo de Santo Tomas told the Council of the Indies that Potosi was a &quot;mouth of hell&quot; which swallowed Indians by the thousands every year, and that rapacious mine owners treated them &quot;like stray animals.&quot; Later Fray Rodrigo de Loaysa said: &quot;These poor Indians are like sardines in the sea. Just as other fish pursue the sardines to seize and devour them, so everyone in these lands pursues the wretched Indians.&quot; Chiefs of Indian communities had to replace the constantly dying mitayos with new men between eighteen and fifty years old. The huge stone-walled corral where Indians were assigned to mine and mill owners is now used by workers as a football ground. The mitayos' jail\u2014a shapeless mass of ruins\u2014can still be seen at the entrance to Potosi.",

With the guilt, a whole system of rationalizations for guilty consciences was devised. The Indians were used as beasts of burden because they could carry a greater weight than the delicate llama, and this proved that they were in fact beasts of burden. The viceroy of Mexico felt that there was no better remedy for their &quot;natural wickedness&quot; than work in the mines. Juan Gines de Sepulveda, a renowned Spanish theologian, argued that they deserved the treatment they got because their sins and idolatries were an offense to God. The Count de Buffon, a French naturalist, noted that Indians were cold and weak creatures in whom &quot;no activity of the soul&quot; could be observed. The Abbe De Paw invented a Latin America where degenerate Indians lived side by side with dogs that couldn't bark, cows that couldn't be eaten, and impotent camels. Voltaire's Latin America was inhabited by Indians who were lazy and stupid, pigs with navels on their backs, and bald and cowardly lions. Bacon, De Maistre, Montesquieu, Hume, and Bodin declined to recognize the &quot;degraded men&quot; of the New World as fellow humans. Hegel spoke of Latin America's physical and spiritual impotence and said the Indians died when Europe merely breathed on them.\n<br>\nIn the seventeenth century Father Gregorio Garcia detected Semitic blood in the Indians because, like the Jews, &quot;they are lazy, they do not believe in the miracles of Jesus Christ, and they are ungrateful to the Spaniards for all the good they have done them.&quot; At least this holy man did not deny that the Indians were descended from Adam and Eve: many theologians and thinkers had never been convinced by Pope Paul III's bull of 1537 declaring the Indians to be &quot;true men.&quot; When Bartolome\u0301 de las Casas upset the Spanish Court with his heated denunciations of the conquistadors' cruelty in 1557, a member of the Royal Council replied that Indians were too low in the human scale to be capable of receiving the faith. Las Casas dedicated his zealous life to defending the Indians against the excesses of the mine owners and encomenderos.

In Mexico, it was the supreme court of administration and judgment.) of Guadalajara that a third of Latin America's Indians had already been wiped out, and that those who survived were compelled to pay the tributes for the dead. The monarch added that Indians were bought and sold; that they slept in the open air; and that mothers killed their children to save them from the torture of the mines. Yet the Crown's hypocrisy had smaller limits than the empire: it received a fifth of the value of the metals extracted by its subjects in all of the Spanish New World, as well as other taxes, and the Portuguese Crown was to have the same arrangement in eighteenth- century Brazil. Latin American silver and gold\u2014as Engels put it\u2014penetrated like a corrosive acid through all the pores of Europe's moribund feudal society, and, for the benefit of nascent mercantilist capitalism, the mining entrepreneurs turned Indians and black slaves into a teeming &quot;external proletariat&quot; of the European economy. Greco-Roman slavery was revived in a different world; to the plight of the Indians of the exterminated Latin American civilizations was added the ghastly fate of the blacks seized from African villages to toil in Brazil and the Antilles. The colonial Latin American economy enjoyed the most highly concentrated labor fore known until that time, making possible the greatest concentration of wealth ever enjoyed by any civilization in world history.<br>\n\u2003\u2003\nThe price of the tide of avarice, terror, and ferocity bearing down on these regions was Indian genocide: the best recent investigations credit pre- Columbian Mexico with a population between 30 and 37.5 million, and the Andean region is estimated to have possessed a similar number; Central America had between 10 and 13 million. The Indians of the Americas totaled no less than 70 million when the foreign conquerors appeared on the horizon; a century and a half later they had been reduced to 3.5 million. In 1685 only 4,000 Indian families remained of the more than 2 million that had once lived between Lima and Paita, according to the Marquis of Barinas. Archbishop Lin\u0303an y Cisneros denied that the Indians had been annihilated: &quot;The truth is that they are hiding out,&quot; he said, &quot;to avoid paying tribute, abusing the liberty which they enjoy and which they never had under the Incas.&quot;\n\n<br><br><font style=\"color:#cc0000;font-size:80%\"><i>Pictured, Philip II</i></font>\n",
