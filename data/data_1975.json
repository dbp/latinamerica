Stroessner routinely imprisoned scores of Paraguayan political opponents, some of whom later insisted that they had endured unethical medical experiments under Mengele's jurisdiction.

Since then, bringing Stroessner to justice was a slow and ultimately futile process. His mouthpiece, the ruling Partido Colorado, remained hesitant to reveal any details about the late dictator's pathological practices. While in exile, Stroessner was careful not to voice any controversial opinions regarding Latin American issues in order not to embarrass his hosts. He also never traveled outside of Brazil, hoping to avoid the fate of his Chilean counterpart Augusto Pinochet, who was arrested on charges of genocide and terrorism while traveling to London in 1998 on medical grounds. He died in 2006 at the age 93, successfully avoiding justice.\n<br>\nAs dictator, Alfredo Stroessner, received $146 million in US aid, never receiving condemnations for its human rights abuses, the genocide of the indigenous Ache, drug trafficking and open arms policy for ex-Nazis until the 1980s.

Brazilian clerics began writing treatises in 1959, and during a spirit of openness before and during the Second Vatican Council, critical analysis of the Church's role began to spread across the continent. The Peruvian priest Gustavo Gutierrez was an early leader in these discussions, sharpening the discourse during meetings in Cuba, Mexico and South America. At the Medellin Conference in 1968, priests and others began to coalesce into a movement, and in 1971, Gutierrez coined the term Liberation Theology, just as the church leadership regionally and globally began to turn against them. Cardinal Ratzenberger (now Pope Benedict XVI) issued the Vatican's first official condemnations of Liberation Theology as Marxist in 1984 after meetings with CELAM bishops.",

The implication is that US military intervention would take place in October 1962\u2014when the missile crisis erupted.\n<br>\nIn February 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a plan more extreme than Schlesinger's: to use &quot;covert means . . . to lure or provoke Castro, or an uncontrollable subordinate, into an overt hostile reaction against the United States; a reaction which would in turn create the justification for the US to not only retaliate but destroy Castro with speed, force and determination.&quot; In March, at the request of the DOD Cuba Project, the Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a memorandum to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara outlining &quot;pretexts which they would consider would provide justification for US military intervention in Cuba.&quot; The plan would be undertaken if &quot;a credible internal revolt is impossible of attainment during the next 9-10 months,&quot; but before Cuba could establish relations with Russia that might &quot;directly involve the Soviet Union.&quot;\n<br>\nOn August 23 the president issued National Security Memorandum No. 181, &quot;a directive to engineer an internal revolt that would be followed by U.S. military intervention,&quot; involving &quot;significant U.S. military plans, maneuvers, and movement of forces and equipment&quot; that were surely known to Cuba and Russia.

Hoping to professionalize Guatemala's intelligence system, Longan and other American advisors centralized the operations of the police and military, training them to gather, analyze and act on intelligence in a coordinated and rapid manner. Longan identified a need for &quot;fundamental elementary work in organization, coordination, and basic police activity.&quot; On December 5, he held the first in a series of workshops with the heads of the Judicial and National Police, military officers, including Colonel Rafael Arriaga Bosque, and two other US public safety advisors. Longan laid out plans for combined &quot;overt&quot; and &quot;covert&quot; operations collectively called &quot;Operacion Limpieza&quot; - Operation Cleanup. In the overt phase of the operation, the &quot;Army, the Judicial Police, and the National Police&quot; would carry out sweeps in &quot;suspect areas in hope that some criminal or subversive elements could be caught in net and lead to further openings.&quot; Longan instructed the officers in a maneuver dubbed the &quot;frozen area plan,&quot; which entailed the cordoning off a four block radius, establishing an outer perimeter, and searching the secured area for subversives and information. On the covert side, Longan recommended the creation of a small &quot;action unit to mastermind campaign against terrorists which would have access to all information from law enforcement agencies. . . .&quot; A team of &quot;trusted investigators&quot; would work from a &quot;special room to be called 'The Box,'&quot; a 24-hour nerve center equipped with telecommunications and electronic surveillance equipment staffed by military colonels and captains and located at Matamoros, the military's general headquarters in downtown Guatemala City. Responsibility for the full operation, including command of &quot;The Box,&quot; was given to Arriaga Bosque, the commanding officer of Matamoros. The overt and covert sides of the proposed operation complemented each other. Intelligence picked up from wide sweeps using the frozen area plan was to be sent to 'The Box' to be analyzed and deployed in more focused clandestine raids, which in turn would provide information for larger dragnets.\n<br>\nEquipped with state of the art telecommunications and surveillance equipment and operating out of military headquarters, Arriaga began to carry out widespread raids. By the end of February, eighty operations\u2014and a number of extrajudicial executions\u2014had taken place. Then between March 3 and March 5, Operacion Limpieza netted its largest catch. On March 2, the military and police picked up three guerrilla leaders. On the third, the police captured Leonardo Leonardo Castillo Flores, who headed the national peasant union under Arbenz, and three \n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"virtualpage3 hidepiece columns\">\nother PGT-FAR members on the south coast. The next day, the fourth, special security officers from Guatemala City arrived to interrogate the prisoners, which according to a CIA document apparently yielded information on Guatemala City safe houses. The following day, the police and military detained a number of PGT leaders, including Victor Manuel Gutierrez - the head of the national labor union under Arbenz. <img src=\"http://hiaw.org/defcon2/mapimages/victormanuelgutierrez.jpg\">By March 5, security forces had captured scores of members of the PGT, FAR, and MR-13 (a Trotskist split from the FAR) in coordinated operations throughout the country, including the capital and the southern coast. The oft stated US goal of effective use of intelligence and coordinated operations between police and military and between the countryside and the city was now a reality.\n<br>\nJudicial Police took Gutierrez to their downtown headquarters, where they submitted him to a torture dubbed la capucha. They covered his head with cowl and shocked him with electric currents, which according to one witness quickly proved too much for Gutierrez, who suffered from a frail heart. Security forces transferred most of the rest of those captured in Guatemala City to the Matamoros military base, where 'The Box' was located. They were interrogated, tortured, executed, and their bodies placed in sacks and dropped into the Pacific. Years later, Longan recalled that some of their remains washed back onto shore. The exact number is not known, but, along with Castillo Flores and Gutierrez, the police and military murdered at least thirty people over the course of four days. In July, a defector from the national police told the newspaper El Grafico that execution orders came from Arriaga Bosque, the man in charge of the new US &quot;action unit.&quot; US embassy officials admitted that the killings were carried out under the auspices of Operacion Limpieza. The embassy's March progress report, which enumerated its paragraphs, stated in paragraph number four that the Guatemalan government scored &quot;a considerable success when they captured a number of leading Communists, including Victor Manuel Gutierrez [and] Leonardo Castillo Flores.&quot; Paragraph twenty-three then matter-of-factly noted that the police &quot;have conducted 80 raids during the past month using the 'frozen area plan'. The raids have been productive in apprehensions (see paragraph 4).&quot; Despite pleas from Guatemala's archbishop and over 500 petitions of habeas corpus filed by relatives, the government and the American Embassy remained silent about the fate of the executed.\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"source\">Greg Grandin",

Buenos Aires, 1936), in collaboration with other Argentine filmmakers, filmed a chapter of Argentina, mayo de 1969: los caminos de la liberaci\u00f3n. The film has never been restored in its entirety, and few have seen it. Nevertheless, it remains a legendary testimony to collective political unrest, particularly influential for its promotion of cinema as a new vehicle of protest against a ruling regime.\nSolanas\u2019 filmic inspirations were not exclusively cinematic: his earlier studies in literature, music, dance and law led him to pursue theater arts at the Conservatory of Dramatic Arts (Conservatorio de Arte Dram\u00e1tico), where cinema would eventually seduce him. His career in cinema began at age 26, with the filming of Seguir andando (1962). Another short film, Reflexi\u00f3n ciudadana (1963), followed a year later. \nLike his friend Octavio Getino, Solanas was a Peronist, and in 1968 the two men directed the most influential political documentary of the era: La hora de los hornos: Notas y testimonios sobre el neocolonialismo, la violencia y la liberaci\u00f3n. Divided into three parts, the 255-minute documentary managed to be many things at once: instrument of leftist political and social protest; manifesto; educational cinematic debate; essay of cultural interpretation of Latin America in general and of Argentina in particular; a filmic collage, collecting and juxtaposing fragments from other films of the period; active artifact in the democratization of images; unofficial history. It was also the most controversial film of the 1960s.  \n<br>\nSolanas and Getino also founded the Grupo Cine Liberaci\u00f3n and developed the theory of \u201cThird Cinema\u201d: a cinema that is neither commercial nor authorial, emerging instead from the public at large. Meanwhile, the two kept in close contact with Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n during his exile in Madrid (1955-1974), following his removal from power in the so-called Liberating Revolution (Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora). The relationship resulted in their 1971 film, Per\u00f3n: Actualizaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y doctrinaria para la toma del poder. \n<br>\nSolanas\u2019 second full-length film, Los hijos de Fierro (1972), appropriated a well-known literary character in order to experiment with combining scenes of fiction and documentary. This innovation achieves an extremely personal reading of Mart\u00edn Fierro, the classic \u201cgauchesco\u201d poem of 1872. Adding to the film\u2019s unique ambition, much of the dialogue is written in the same octosyllabic meter as Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s poem. Given the poem\u2019s fundamental role in Argentine culture, it becomes a poignant frame of reference and brilliant backdrop for a complex film that oscillates between epic and lyric, realist and mythic, allowing the poem\u2019s \u201ccharacters\u201d and scenarios to articulate a political allegory of the 1970s in Argentina.  \nIn 1975, the military executed another coup d\u2019etat in Argentina. The following year, Solanas went into exile. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<font style=\"display:none\">\n\n\n\n\nGrupo Cine Liberacion, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, Cine Base Formed (1973), letters from Peron</font>",

Violence and disease, the advance guard of civilization: for the Indian, contact with the white man continues to be contact with death. Every legal dispensation since 1537 meant to protect Brazil's Indians has been turned against them. Under every Brazilian constitution they are &quot;the original and natural masters&quot; of the land they occupy, but the richer that virgin land proves to be, the greater the threat hanging over their lives. Nature's very generosity makes them targets of plunder and crime. Indian hunting has become ferocious in recent years; the world's greatest forest, a huge tropical zone open to legend and adventure, has inspired a new &quot;American dream.&quot; Men and business enterprises from the United States, a new procession of conquistadores, have poured into Amazonia as if it were another Far West. This U.S. invasion has inflamed the avarice of Brazilian adventurers as never before. The Indians die out leaving no trace, and the land is sold for dollars to the new interested parties. Gold and other plentiful minerals, timber and rubber, riches whose commercial value the Indians are not even aware of, recur in the reports of each of the few investigations that have been made. It is known that the Indians have been machine-gunned from helicopters and light airplanes and inoculated with smallpox virus, that dynamite has been tossed into their villages, and that they have been given gifts of sugar mixed with strychnine and salt mixed with arsenic. The director of the Indian Protection Service, named by the Castelo Branco dictatorship to clean up its administration, was himself accused, with proof, of committing forty-two different kinds of crimes against the Indians. That scandal broke in 1968.",

Students from UNAM and workers in repressed trade unions spent much of the summer demonstrating against police assaults on the autonomy of school campuses, and the general state of repression under the PRI's single party rule. In the beginning of August (during the Mexican school year), tens of thousands of colleged students undertook a notably non-violent march and began an occupation of the university. During massive marches in mid-September, the President sent troops in to violently break up the students' control of the campus and other parts of the city. During the military attacks on the occupation of the Polytechnic campuses on September 23rd, students put up resistance and were fired upon. Fifteen were killed. A demonstration was held on October 2nd in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, ten days before the city was to host the 1968 Olympics. Thousands of soldiers and hundreds of armored trucks and tanks surrounded the students. From hundreds and up to a thousand were gunned down.\n<br>\nThe repression convinces many activists to carry their struggle underground. Over the next decade, over two dozen urban guerilla groups develop through-out Mexico. The most active guerilla activity is between 1971 and 1975. Most movements disintegrate under brutal repression and a dirty war, which leave over hundreds of activists &quot;disappeared&quot; and over 1,000 dead.\n<br>\n An investigation completed in 2001 declared that the army's claim that students fired first from nearby apartments was false, and that it had been Presidential Guard agents who are begun firing at the soldiers to serve as the impetus for the massacre. In 2003, a series of Freedom of Information Act releases proved there was some United States complicity in the overall repression. The day is now remembered in Mexico City as the National Day of Mourning. ",

They embarked on a process of collecting archive material\u2014newsreels\u2014and recording testimonies of militants of the so-called Peronist Resistance (a period of popular struggles beginning with Peron's fall in 1955), of intellectuals and university leaders. This search made the filmmakers travel all over the country and was reflected in the film's subtitle, 'Notes and Testimonies on Neocolonialism, Violence and Liberation'.\n<br>\nThroughout this process (from late 1965 to mid-1968), the directors gradually modified their original proposal and part of their ideas. They incorporated the revisionist view of history and a look on the Peronist working class as the main subject of Argentina's revolutionary transformation. They experienced, as well as many other intellectuals in those years, a journey from the traditional left into a national left. With a new military regime coming to power in 1966, because of the film's adhesion to proscribed Peronism and in particular to its most radicalised wing, its revolutionary proposals and the will to inscribe it into the struggles for social change, they had to resort to an alternative exhibition circuit.\n<br>\nThe formal organisation of La Hora de los Hornos is inextricably linked to these objectives. Its total running time of four hours 15 minutes is structured into three parts, each with a different formal treatment, theme and even objective. The first section, 'Neocolonialism and Violence', was conceived as an essay film, which discusses the neocolonial nature of Argentine and Latin American dependency through 13 chapters. The second part, 'Act for Liberation', is divided in two, reflecting specific time periods: Chronicle of Peronism and Chronicle of Resistance. Conceived as a film act and dedicated to the 'Peronist proletarians', these two chronicles respectively deal with an analysis of the ten years of Peronism in power (1946-55) and a critical reconstruction of the ensuing struggles (1956-66). The third part, 'Violence and Liberation', dedicated to 'the new man who is being born out of this liberation war', presents itself as a study on the meaning of violence. (<i>The entire film can be found online</i>)\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"entry columns3\" style=\"font-size:x-small;background-color:#E8E8E8;padding:10px;\">\n&quot;Guerrilla film-making proletarianises the film worker and breaks down the intellectual aristocracy that the bourgeoisie grants to its followers. In a word, it democratises. The film-maker's tie with reality makes him more a part of his people. Vanguard layers and even masses participate collectively in the work when they realise that it is the continuity of their daily struggle. La hora de los hornos shows how a film can be made in hostile circumstances when it has the support and collaboration of militants and cadres from the people.\n<br>\n&quot;The revolutionary film-maker acts with a radically new vision of the role of the producer, team-work, tools, details, etc. Above all, he supplies himself at all levels in order to produce his films, he equips himself at all levels, he learns how to handle the manifold techniques of his craft. His most valuable possessions are the tools of his trade, which form part and parcel of his need to communicate. The camera is the inexhaustible expropriator of image-weapons; the projector, a gun that can shoot 24 frames per second.&quot; \u2014Directors Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino &quot;Towards a Third Cinema&quot;\n",

US aid &quot;saved the day&quot; for the ruling Generals; the process also &quot;turned the U.S. into a kind of unilateral IMF, overseeing every aspect of Brazilian economic policy.&quot; &quot;In almost every Brazilian office involved in administering unpopular tax, wage, or price decisions, there was the ubiquitous American adviser,&quot; the new US Ambassador discovered in 1966. Once again, the US was well-positioned to use Brazil as a &quot;testing area for modern scientific methods of industrial development&quot; (Haines), and therefore has every right to take credit for what ensued. Under US guidance, Brazil pursued orthodox neoliberal policies, &quot;doing everything right&quot; by monetarist criteria, and &quot;strengthening the market economy&quot; (Skidmore). The &quot;economic miracle&quot; proceeded in parallel with the entrenchment of the fascist National Security State, not accidentally; a regime that could not wield the knout could hardly have carried out measures with such a deleterious impact on the population. <br>\nThe President announced in 1970 that repression would be &quot;harsh and implacable,&quot; with no rights for &quot;pseudo-Brazilians.&quot; Torture became &quot;a grisly ritual, a calculated onslaught against body and soul,&quot; Skidmore writes, with such specialties as torture of children and gang rape of wives before the family. The &quot;orgy of torture&quot; provided &quot;a stark warning&quot; to anyone with the wrong thoughts. It was a &quot;powerful instrument,&quot; that &quot;made it even easier for Delfim and his technocrats to avoid public debate over fundamental economic and social priorities&quot; while they &quot;preached the virtues of the free market.&quot; The resumption of high economic growth, by these means, made Brazil &quot;again attractive to foreign private investors,&quot; who took over substantial parts of the economy. By the late 1970s, &quot;The industries dominated by local capital in Brazil [were] the same industries where small businesses flourish in the United States&quot;; multinationals and their local associates dominated the more profitable growth areas, though with the changes in the global economy, about 60 percent of foreign capital was then non-US (Peter Evans).

There is no mention of any trade unions, but employers will properly read between the lines that unions have been broken and pacified (with the assistance of George Meany and the AFL-CIO). Of special interest is the regular use of government troops and police to break up independent unions. The agricultural union Sindicato Unido, which operated the fields now owned by G &amp; W was broken by police action in 1966 and 1967, and a number of its leaders, including the union lawyer Guido Gil were arrested and killed by the forces of law and order. \n<br>Another major foreign enterprise, Falconbridge Nickel, also successfully broke a union with army and police assistance in 1970. A Wall Street Journal report of September 9, 1971 states that &quot;when a union attempted to organize construction workers at a foreign-owned ferronickel mill project last year, Mr. Balaguer sent in the army to help straighten things out. While the soldiers kept order, the contractors fired 32 allegedly leftist leaders...The strike was broken in eight days.&quot; Matters had not changed much in the mid-70s. An ad hoc human rights group that visited the Dominican Republic in 1975 reported that &quot;working people have been prevented by nearly every conceivable means from forming and joining trade union organizations.&quot; A union organizing effort in the G &amp; W free trade zone in the mid-1970s was broken with the help of the police in arresting, jailing, and deporting labor organizers, and with the use of &quot;troops in full combat gear armed with submachine guns&quot; to break up organizing meetings. Flannery states that:\n<i>\n&quot;Officials of the Dominican labor ministry told organizers that\u2014contrary to the paper guarantees of the republic's laws\u2014workers would not be allowed to form a union in the industrial free zone.&quot;\n</i>\nOn the matter of labor unions, the 1977 State Department Human Rights Report has the following &quot;information&quot;: \n<i>\n&quot;Labor unions are permitted to function and numerous labor unions exist including some associated with opposition parties, but under some government controls.&quot;</i> That exhausts that topic.\n\n<br>In containing unions and rendering them docile the Dominican elite has had the steadfast support of the top echelons of the AFL-CIO, which has long cooperated closely with the CIA and international business firms in this unsavory operation. Its arm CONATRAL actually helped destroy the pro-labor Bosch regime in 1963 and has steadily supported its totalitarian and anti-labor successors.&quot;' Presumably their blind hatred of Communism and radicalism in general has led Meany and his close followers to sell out systematically the interests of labor in the Dominican Republic and in other U. S. satellites. \n<br>Meany and some other labor bosses actually have a more direct interest in the pacification of labor in the Dominican Republic. Meany, his number two man Lane Kirkland, Alexander Barkan, director of COPE, the AFL-CIO political arm, and Edward J. Carlough, president of the sheet metal workers, all are stockholders in the 15,000 acre Punta Cana resort and plantation in the Dominican Republic. In order to clear the ground for this enterprise designed for the Beautiful People a large numbers of squatters were evicted by the army.",
