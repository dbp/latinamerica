By 1600, it is reported that the Yanga maroon settlement, or palenques, was joined by Francisco de la Matosa and his group of African maroons. All of this occurred before the independence of Mexico from the Spanish crown. \n\nYanga's early palenques would turn into decades-long resistance against colonial Spain. In 1609, Spain's viceroy of New Spain (the colonial name of Mexico) was Luis de Velasco, Marquis of Salinas. That year, Velasco sent Captain Pedro Gonzalez on a military expedition against the Yanga palenques. The battle came to a head at the Rio Blanco and resulted in major losses on both sides. By 1631, viceroy of New Spain Rodrigo Pacheco began negotiations with the Gaspar Yanga resistance. Yanga struck an agreement with the colonial leader respecting Spain's recognition of an autonomous region for the African community. The first official name was San Lorenzo de los Negros (aka San Lorenzo de Cerralvo), near Cordova. Since 1932, the Mexican town has bore the name of its liberator Gasper Yanga. \n\n",

Entering Atotonilco, the Indians killed ten missionaries and 200 civilians. That same night they surrounded to Santiago Papasquiaro, where the Christians resisted 17 days. The Tepehuanes Indians had limited success in trying to enlist the aid of the Conchos Indians who lived around the Parras mission, on the northern edge of the Tepehuan territory. On the other hand, they had considerable success in getting the Acaxees and Xiximes to attack Spanish mines and settlements in western Nueva Vizcaya. However, when the Tepehuanes advanced on the recently converted Acaxee pueblos of Tecucuoapa and Carantapa, the 130 Acaxee warriors decided to side with the Spaniards and decisively defeated their Tepehuan neighbors. Because the loyalties of the Acaxees and Xiximes were divided, the Spaniards were able to extinguish their uprising more rapidly.\n<br>\nNative allies of the Spaniards were crucial in mounting an effective defense against the Tepehuanes and in putting down the revolt. On December 19, Captain Gaspar de Alvear led a force of sixty-seven armed cavalry and 120 Concho allies into the war zone to confront the insurgents. The hostilities continued until 1620 and laid waste to a large area. When Mateo de Vesga became Governor of Nueva Vizcaya in 1618, he described the province as &quot;destroyed and devastated, almost depopulated of Spaniards.&quot; By the end of the revolt, at least a thousand allied Indians had died, while the Tepehuanes may have lost as many as 4,000 warriors. Professor Spicer regards the Tepehuan revolt as &quot;one of the three bloodiest and most destructive Indian attempts to throw off Spanish control in northwestern New Spain.&quot; Following the revolt, the Tepehuanes fled to mountain retreats to escape Spanish vengeance. Not until 1723 would the Jesuits return to work among them.",

Disease was a blessing from heaven because it meant the approach of death.<br>\nThe slaves were called the &quot;coins of the Indies&quot; when they were measured, weighed and embarked in Luanda in the Portuguese colony of Angola; in Brazil those surviving the ocean voyage became &quot;the hands and feet&quot; of the white master. Angola exported Bantu slaves and elephant tusks in exchange for clothing, liquor, and firearms, but Ouro Preto miners preferred blacks shipped from the little beach of Ouidah on the Gulf of Guinea because they were more vigorous, lasted somewhat longer, and had the magic power to find gold. Every miner also needed a black mistress from Ouidah to bring him luck on his expeditions. (In Cuba, medicinal powers were attributed to female slaves. According to onetime slave Esteban Montejo, &quot;There was one type of sickness the whites picked up, a sickness of the veins and male organs. It could only be got rid of with black women; if the man who had it slept with a Negress he was cured immediately.&quot;) Ouro Preto's appetite for slaves became insatiable; they expired in short order, only in rare cases enduring the seven years of continuous labor. Yet the Portuguese were meticulous in baptizing them all before they crossed the Atlantic, and once in Brazil they were obliged to attend mass, although they were not allowed to sit in the pews or to enter the chanel.\n<br>\nThe gold explosion not only increased the importation of slaves, but absorbed a good part of the black labor from the sugar and tobacco plantations elsewhere in Brazil, leaving them without hands. The miners were contemptuous of farming, and in 1700 and 1713, in the full flush of prosperity, hunger stalked the region: millionaires had to eat cats, rats, ants, and birds of prey. A royal decree in 1711 banned the sale of slaves occupied in agriculture, with the exception of those who showed &quot;perversity of character.&quot;\n<br>\n<img src=\"../mapgimages/middlepassageslavery.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;break-after: always\">\n\n",

Adventurers and fortune hunters poured in. Brazil had 300,000 inhabitants in 1700; a century later, at the end of the gold years, the population had multiplied eleven times. No less than 300,000 Portuguese emigrated to Brazil in the eighteenth century, a larger contingent than Spain contributed to all its Latin American colonies. From the conquest of Brazil until abolition, it is estimated that some 10 million blacks were brought from Africa; there are no precise figures for the eighteenth century, but the gold cycle absorbed slave labor in prodigious quantities.\n<br>\nSalvador de Bahia was the Brazilian capital of the prosperous Northeastern sugar cycle, but the &quot;golden age&quot; in Minas Gerais moved the country's economic and political capital southward and Rio de Janeiro, the region's port, became the new capital in 1763. In the dynamic heart of the new mining economy, camps bloomed abruptly into cities, described by a contemporary colonial authority as &quot;sanctuaries for criminals, vagabonds, and malefactors,&quot; in a vertigo of easy riches. The &quot;Vila Rica de Ouro Preto&quot; (The &quot;Rich Town of Black Gold,&quot; so called because the mined gold turned black on exposure to the humid air, due to the presence of silver. -Trans.) had grown to city size by 1711; born of the miners' avalanche, it was the quintessence of the gold civilization. Simao Ferreira Machado, describing it twenty-three years later, said that the power of Ouro Preto businessmen surpassed by far that of Lisbon's most flourishing merchants: &quot;Hither, as to a port, are directed and collected in the Royal Mint the grandiose amounts of gold from all the Mines. Here dwell the best educated men, both lay and ecclesiastic. Here is the seat of all the nobility and the strength of the military. It is, by virtue of its natural position, the head of the whole of America; and by the wealth of its riches, it is the precious pearl of Brazil.&quot; Another writer of the period, Francisco Tavares de Brito, in 1732 defined Ouro Preto as &quot;the Potosi of gold.&quot;",

The revolt was scheduled for October 11, the anniversary of the King's coronation; a grand ball was to have been given in honor of the occasion, and the Negroes planned to blow up the Governor's house, the explosion serving as the signal for a general massacre of the whites. The ball was deferred on account of the Governor's son, and the conspiracy was betrayed by an accomplice. The chief figures in the plot included three waiting men, thirteen carpenters, eight coopers, one coppersmith, one sugar boiler, two masons, one butcher, twenty-six drivers, three coachmen, one head field negro, one millwright, three fishermen, one wheelwright, one 'obeah man', and three fiddlers\u2014some of the most trusted and valuable slaves. The leader, who called himself King Court, and his two generals, Tomboy and Hercules, were broken on the wheel; so were three others. Six slaves were gibbeted, seventy-seven burned alive, and thirty-six banished.\nA commission of inquiry stated that the admission of slaves into 'occupations truly proper only for freemen' was an underlying cause of the insurrection, and it recommended that slaves should be debarred from becoming tradesmen, overseers, drivers, distillers, shopkeepers, hawkers, peddlers, sailers, fiddlers for gain, or from keeping horses or working out for themselves. Tomboy had been a master mason who had been allowed by his master to take negro apprentices and make what profit he could out of his own and their labor. He paid his owner a fixed sum per month, and it was stated that the remainder of his earnings had been invested in the revolt. ",
