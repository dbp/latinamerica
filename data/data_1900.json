A band of about 300 adventurers, mainly negroes from Jamaica, had occupied the port of San Juan del Norte, and began to commit depredations upon an adjacent settlement of Americans known as Punta Arenas. Finally they organised a strong force to demolish tho little colony at Punta Arenas, but their design was defeated by the interposition of an American warship which happened to be in the harbor. \n<img src=\"mapimages/nicaragua1854.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%\">In May of 1854 matters were further complicated by the attempt of a body of men from Greytown to arrest in Punta Arenas the captain of one of the boats of the Accessory Transit Company of Nicaragua on a charge of murder. Solon Borland, the American minister to powers, Central Ammica, happened to be present on this occasion, and, believing that the captain of the steamboat was innocent and that the intruding party had no jurisdiction, interposed effectually to prevent violence and bloodshed. Borland afterward visited Grey town and, while there, was subjected to insult by a mob. On receiving offical accounts of these occurences, the sloop of war <i>Cyane</i> was sent to enforce the demands of the American government\u2014that the people of Greytown make reparation for injuries to our citizens and due-apology for their insult to Borland. But the Greytown people evinced no disposition to comply, so on July 9, 1854, after 24 hours' notice had been given, the <i>Cyane</i> opened fire on the town. Before much injury had been done the <i>Cyane</i> suspended fire in order to afford opportunity of complying with the demands which had been made. As nothing was heard from the town authorities, however, the <i>Cyane</i> continued the bombardment until the town was laid in ashes. No lives were lost and most of the buildings destroyed were of little value.&quot;This transaction,&quot; said the President, &quot;has been the subject of complaint on the part of some foreign powers and has been characterized with more of harshness than of justice.&quot; (From <i>The United States: its beginnings, progress and modern development, Volume 7</i> by Jesse Ames Spencer; 1913)\n",

Finally, it made its capital the Mexican port of Veracruz on May 4, 1858. The United States recognized the Mexican government there in\n1859 and gave arms to the liberals. The liberal army under Santos Degollado (d. 1861) fought in the west but lost every major battle, includ-\ning notable defeats at Tacubaya (April 11, 1859) and Celaya (November 1859).

Over time, the Indian society lost its military coloration as Moravian missionaries from Bethlehem, PA, and American and British companies like Standard Fruit moved into the area. Along with the foreign companies and the missionaries came small businessmen-many of them Britons, Germans, and Americans-who settled in the interior of the Rio Coco. They settled into the region, married Indian women, and set up trading posts, ranches, boat yards, and lumber supply areas along the river. These people, called &quot;bamboo whites&quot; by the Marines, shipped raw wood from inside Nicaragua to sawmills located at Puerto Cabezas on the coast. Both politically and economically, they would prove critical in the war with Sandino.\n<br>\nAs a result of all these developments-missionary activity, the development of foreign owned &quot;big businesses&quot; along the coast, and the addition of a new strata of &quot;bamboo businessmen&quot; to the area's social structure-the Miskito remained more connected to the United States and the English-speaking Caribbean than to Hispanic Nicaragua. But if local history and economics pushed the coast in one direction, geopolitics moved it in another. Backed by pressure from the United States, Great Britain dropped the coast from protectorate status and officially ceded the area to Nicaragua in 1860. Since Nicaragua was too weak to exercise its claim, the coast remained in political limbo for decades until Nicaraguan President Jose Santos Zelaya sent troops into the area to capture Bluefields in 1894.\n<br>\nDespite military occupation by Spanish-speaking troops, the Indians continued to resent the Nicaraguans. The inhabitants of the coast also kept looking to Great Britain for support (several British and American businessmen did sell them arms).  In 1894, the Miskito Reserve was dissolved \u2014 &quot;reincorporated&quot; into the Nicaraguan state \u2014 which led to a local uprising that was eventually quelled by the US Marines. \n<br>\nIn the years following the 1894 takeover, Black Creoles and Miskito Indians would pepper the British Foreign Office with petitions that asked the British to retake their territory, a tradition that would continue until the late 1950s. This fraught relationship with the Nicaraguan government would lead to troubles well in to the 1980s.\n<br>\n\n\n",

Uprisings in February fail, and the Mambi leaders, as the revolutionaries were called, land in April. Marti, who had spent many years raising funds and support from Cuban and leftist communities in the United States and Spain, is killed on May 19th of 1895. By 1898, the revolutionaries controlled half the island despite the 200,000 Spanish troops sent against them. That year, the US sent the warship USS Maine to Havana. Its explosion, which killed 258 troops aboard, remains a mystery to this day, but was used as grounds by President William McKinley to attack. US troops were sent to other Spanish colonies, including Puerto Rico and the Philippines where their own wars of independence were under way. The United States took both of the latter countries as colonies, killing hundreds of thousands of local rebels in the ensuing years, and in December of 1898, took it upon itself to sign the Treaty of Paris with Spain which recognized Cuban independence. Of course, no Cuban was involved in the signing. ",
